You worked really really hard to have a basic lifestyle that you can afford to live and if you're not even able to maintain that lifestyle it is not a budgeting issue a systematic explain as to why that is happening at what rate the price Rises happening so it is happening at a much faster rate compared to the rice in your salaries now you say that government this. You don't know any data can you show us in an organised sector are these houses on yourself can run a small experiment you your check sent a letter 23 years ago and checked to see monthly expenses now increase in Price Rite on your lifestyle on the flip side salad Eli's not your salary is a package being so that will give you an idea as to what create the salary increases happening and I'm willing to bet that the rate at which Saloon is going up that is far more this month and you don't want my salary is not growing at a very fast rate inflation is going up in the economy very very fast so what is the reason for that is there any explanation for this can be boiled down into two simple sentences which goes something like this so This is called as capitalizing. but socializing tell us what is the meaning of this story about Vladimir Putin you schedule a meeting me how is he the richest person on earth you fax number to get out of 10 richest Russian twerk in infrastructure oriented transport this development has become extremely well-armed company they get in contact after contracts. The company is able to do everything well that project and start making money who do you think will benefit from that you take 10 days of when are you getting treated on unit and 99.9 unit will go to the major infrastructure projects in banking project Fierce men who pays the cost you think example I created an entire history please go and watch it who do you think eventually build out vs find the answer comes that the government bailout Mojave rational brain. Please ask. Who finances being basically it was the public money belonged to a few and losses belonged to many that is being out at the world including in India particular political party now you might have an answer my question. Okay. Was out of the window for example recently updated mutual fund indexation benefits taxes are not fighting corporate taxes are in fact coming now. Eating some numbers on what your life look like with one lakh rupee in Delhi and even if it's not said you can live a very comfortable life why does that happen because even inflation which acts as an indirect tax that is levied on all why doesn't happen because losses whenever companies like yours Mike they fall under the entire Society pays the price in these two for Matt and Krista and people were actually making one like 42 minutes so now I'm debating that question. You know what you know what the God will not work in our favor you're probably giving some wrong data a situation where losses can be spread over in the form of higher Taxation and higher inflation across people how is this supposed to be an Austrian economics 23 minutes to walk you through this highly complicated topic would be fascinated with it hopefully and if you would like it if you pick this difference so basically you didn't like it at first why are you have something planned economy of these two schools since that time this will of course have came into existence there's a lot of debate and it will probably take me 3 hours to explain the difference between the food of tortillas so I'll be schools that I've actually impacting you know all the way till the covid-19 but after 2020 there wasn't a cycle in the economy that their appearance of growth and there is a piece of string gauge that happens if I'm back during the growth cycle people are very happy but if you didn't go down for this is where people start pointing fingers at each other example of the Great Depression existed in the 1920s and musically you should give a lot of power or interventionist power to the government because they have been someone needs to post it so you give a lot of power to the government who quantitative easing getting his other day telling me about intervene in the economy to kick-start a jump-start the economy is that you know what this is a very bad idea. Intervene during all the down face up to that had to go to the economy or something bad in the economy that has happened to the cycle that is happening in will be there but they said that you know what just being 100 units if you just simply print money or take more day and pump it down before the fire so the government started printing more money whenever they saw a problem. 2020-21 even more now. give me the time that how many chickens have come home to roost and how are you seeing this again let me take back to the chart that I was explaining that if the inflation and Taxation is growing like this your salary as a middle-class person is growing like The Bling, do you think that this pain will go away the answer is absolutely not this pain will Indian economy remains at the Forefront of question that if this situation continues that every time there's been in the economy government will bring the money used Indian principal about the situation and put more taxation put more information on our head to whom does it impact the most or how are different years of people get impacted the for specific segments that is from an Indian context when it comes to what happened these people might have like net worth of Letter 23 + all that stuff maybe some transfer or inheritance tax might be levied on them but what kind of upsets them is that they own the means of production in economics we have the concept of means of production which means land labor and capital if you only these three things that you were technically once means of production for example if he'll eat or I'll drive every person has so you got offline this. We are on England now if the inflation in the economy goes up and take a look at this situation that is happening in Bangalore in Bangalore B rent has been steadily increased for a lot of people by 45% this year itself or whose property has appreciated and because of it we have become culturally this can also be a check from this particular graphic and you can take a look at me with share of the top ten percent that it has been driving decade after decade in India and 50% don't buy that this happened it happened because who owns the means of production that is the reason why a man who has 125 squats so you would be considered as well enjoy and chill in my life because the inflation is going very fast. How much of a mutual fund indexation benefits have been withdrawn who invest in mutual funds station benefits although that was supposed to say this but these people are living hand-to-mouth. They will go and do they hurt and whatever money they are making at the end of that day's labor going to go home and eat whatever reality of most people in India government benefits mostly they depend on it until they are you all that stuff even for Healthcare on any type of dependent on the government so they absolutely need Saturdays in order to survive and this rain is going to continue running to me I think that is going to happen in our economy is that people are going to say less and less in fact saving money is going to become more and more difficult with fine in fact even checked this and here and it shows the savings rate of the point that is definitely going to happen is that the middle class is going to get brutally why don't the middle 40% that you see that according to me is that he is going to grow smaller and smaller with the middle class or middle 40% yes 45% of 22.9 will fall below 15%. 30 thing that is going to happen is that people are going to find it harder and harder to beat inflation the government gives a percentage calculator how much baby money to buy makana these days is very hard to be a city in Vietnam / would I receive my money what the problem now is that has the inflation in the world will increase I believe it goes again going back to the basic point. I explained that you know what you doing boo X the government will not take any action during the time of loss LivingSocial is Taxation and inflation problem to the entire audience so this is unfortunately what is happening and therefore money you unfortunately we have to take this with it how do you take a separate conversation I will prop this video is a good response from all of you in the same thing is going to happen with the Indian marriages lasted more than one with his last white collar job people are going to take more and more. is that people are going to take more and more and more very similar to how the US government wants their people to take more than something very similar is happening all across the country means that if you are the husband and your wife is not working for example and if she has an opportunity to work Android support in India are the women Workforce participation is one of the lowest in the world from that perspective in a particular household please try to figure out another way of making such a low income and even be able to manage you need to have more I'm not saying this booklet form o and create fear what is important to actually be educated as to whatever is happening in the world a little peace kept in your bank account and unfortunately inflation is very high Germany and unfortunately you have to take a risk with it we're doing this that I keep on making please understand all the analysis he's learned from others also and use your own brain be responsible for your own money in this entire Journey whenever you are getting your money do we like letting our money no I do not like asking my money and neither would you but there is no other option and there will be times when you will have to be at a loss because you got to spend your money as soon as possible please try to win some inflation-proof Assets Now again whenever I say Bitcoin or whenever I say real estate I get a lot of apple juice in water that is a commercial property because I have a license now that is my perspective you don't necessarily need to follow my perspective but have some you have to go one way or the other and some inflation-proof I hope you enjoy this video If you do consider pressing the like button to share it with your friends I hope you enjoyed the video
