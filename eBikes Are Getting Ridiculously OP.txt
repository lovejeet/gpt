a new video face contest going to be rather magical I'm going to be stealing you guys in on the latest and greatest developments in the rapidly evolving electric bikes / late lunch motorcycle space this Market is currently in its infancy and in a couple years from now I think if you look drastically different and what we talkin about 33 new bikes that are coming out and they were make a pulley different ends of the e-bike spectrum and I want to know your guys thoughts and opinions on what style of biker directions to The Pike Market you prefer let's get right into this let's begin with the news that Honda ya Honda they are making e-bikes and I just one day she just announced three models that Cub the taxi and ready for this does Zoomer e e bikes as you can probably tell represent the more traditional path for the device market so essentially taking existing gas bikes and just converting them to electric and call me the day not saying that's bad or anything the bikes in my opinion do look super fresh and the reason why Honda announced these bikes is because they have a long-term goal of being a net zero carbon emission by like 20 30 40 50 something like that so eventually they are going to be converting all of their products to electric and this is just at the beginning of that I do have to give you the cash out right off the bat that that these bikes as of right now or only for sale in China so they're not coming to the US market as of right now in this form but if I had to guess because of this commitment Honda has eventually are there a version of the bike or something else entirely will hit the US market nothing is still a relative to talk about these bikes have the same aesthetic as their older gas brother that she had pedals on them sit closer look all three of these models have pedals I think the decks actually has pegs and pedals which I found to be hilarious so they are classified as a bikes at the approach her with this take notes for potential us products in the future because there are bikes being sold on the Chinese market they had to follow Chinese e-bike regulations which are bit more strict than in the US for example the maximum speed allowed where is 25 km per hour at about 15 to half mph to these are definitely not Speed Demons by any stretch of the imagination and I guess Shawna just hate seed likes because they also limit the battery voltage to a maximum of 48 bikes ever come to the United States we have to soon they're going to adjust it to American e-bike laws which are more free in nature but the best part about these bikes I haven't told you guys yet is the price tag he's already Chinese prices so is it come to the u.s. give me more expensive in China Beach bikes are $880 that is good considering they look like gun nice Neil's light electric motorcycles scooters in or whatever you that's why the mezz and they're less than a thousand bucks and Electric I'm just saying if you came to the US in the one out pick up especially if they're so cheap I'll definitely pick up the taxi that's the one that just asked ethically appeals to me the most of course I know your favorite in the comments below okay but moving on as mentioned ZZ bikes from Honda or representing one side of Pike Market One Direction which the e-bike market could eventually go into these next to another direction that you could potentially take another tech Gadget like your phone computer to this like right here is actually buy a computer company Acer I'm sure you guys are familiar they make Peters monitors various referral devices in the point of this bike is a high-tech tennis City commuter its extreme lightweight that's in the advertised figure was 35 lb so of course he's not going to have more power than was range what's made as a convenient Urban commuter get around the city easily bring it up and downstairs in an apartment complex  and of course it has a bunch of integrated technology features the headline one is a i this bike has integrated AI the point of it is to learn how you ride and optimize the flight to be as efficient as possible okay cool concept I like it does that transmission right the gears that changes automatically okay cool I like the idea of going to see how it is in practice wants it eventually comes out as other text was like a phone app so you can completely see where the bike is you can track it because I have GPS tracking built in as well you can see where the bike is you can lock it you can settings all of your phone very convenient and here's another similar bike taking a tech-heavy approach all those Sully different so the company here is a sink I think it's a Chinese company and like a self project is currently on Indiegogo the design is very Sleek futuristic design from day one to be electric is not just a gas bike that they converted to electric and it's not from just formed there's actually a function built into the design so this bike is actually full suspension and the rear of a linkage pivot point where you want to call it is integrated inside of the frame that vertical kind of down to section the benefit of that is you don't have to clean it doesn't get dirty doesn't get damaged don't do much adjusting and that along with other design components to HUB motor help this more City commuter to be extremely low maintenance just like with the Acer bikes has a built-in GPS tracking a phone app all of those tacky features built-in a lot more power than the Acer bike this has advertised Peak wattage of 2500w that's not bad the battery is only 48 volts was not a high-voltage system and it comes in two capacities 20 amp hours or 48 Hours whose bike is both much larger and more capable than the Acer bike even though follow the same vision for a place of being Kinder own thing for Tech heavy and I didn't see a price tag for this but if I find it in my research after filming this I'll put on screen right now those are some of the latest developments and products coming to the Evite Market very soon but as mentioned a macro thing going on here is that tug-of-war between what the feature b b b is it going to be on division of just traditional gas motorcycles that are converted to electric or are they going to be another Gadget in your life was doing more of a smartphone on Wheels sleep time in the comments and let us know what direction you would like to see the e-bike market take if you guys still watching and George know I always appreciate it like your content and I'll catch you guys in the next one
