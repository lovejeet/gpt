today's episode of sponsored by kiwico but more in what's inside these boxes in just a bit hint it's science in case you didn't know who I was but you might not on July 16th 1945 physicist Enrico Fermi was standing about 10 miles away from what would become ground zero for the world's first atomic explosion but instead of Simply observing the blast that he personally helped bring into being. Manhattan Project this scientist that he was he was tearing up and dropping small sheets of paper before during and after the explosion once the blast wave reach him about 40 seconds after detonation he used how these pieces of paper fell through the air to estimate that the blast yield for the nuclear bomb the Trinity test is about 10 kilotons of TNT equivalent it turned out later to be calculated as 7:40 songs of TNT he was that close just by looking at how pieces of paper move through the air Enrico Fermi had a legendary ability for estimating very complicated phenomenon for almost no data at all became so good at this in fact that the estimate of this kind became the Fermi estimate and I'm going to show you how to do it today to estimate nearly anything the air is moving around it about 2 kph in here by the way the facility today's program will be all about exercising your brain and thinking about how to think about her so if you want to follow along with me feel free to pause the video anytime grab a sheet of paper and a calculator preferably a TI-89 titanium we begin with the mathematical basis for fermi's legendary estimating ability dimensional analysis dimensional analysis is a way of relating units to one another to quickly convert one unit to another sewing easy example of this would be to ask you how many seconds are in a year this is something that's difficult to know off the top of your head but this is where we apply our analysis we begin with a number that we know like there are 365 days in a year right but we also know relating the units that there are 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour and 50 seconds in a minute now as long as all the units cancel out top and bottom and we're only left with the unit that we want and we can multiply across the top divide across the bottom and we get the second and here a little over thirty one and a half mil it this seems like a simple process and it is that's the power of it but we can do something a lot more difficult than just seconds in a year while we try something a bit more worthy of our Newfound abilities your hair is definitely where the baby a few years ago when I was still trapped in a formless emotionless boy what have you nerds ask me a question and I couldn't possibly know off the top of my head about the top of my head you asked me would all of my golden locks laid end-to-end reach the moon what sounds like a sinus infection may have heard of before about human beings but it's perfect for a Fermi estimation so let's apply the Fermi estimation process the first thing that we're going to do is identifying breakdowns a problem what do we need to know to make a good gift for we need to guess the distance of the Moon the number of hairs on my head and the average length of those hairs the next thing that we're going to do is just throw out some numbers and dare to be imprecise here because over and under estimate 10 to cancel out that's the real secret of this process how far away is the Moon is it 1 km away no is it a million kilometers well it's hard to say where we should land if we don't apply the first step which is bounding the problem use figures and numbers that you have some confidence to start with for example I know that space starts a hundred kilometers above your head and that the Sun from Earth is about 150 million km away so for the moon order of magnitude I'm going to say it's a hundred thousand kilometers away to start in for the number of hairs on my head I'm going to say about thousand because 1000 sounds like too few and 100,000 sounds like way too many and finally for the length of my hair I know it's about the length of my forearm which is 1/3 of a meter or 1 ft now it's time for the dimensional analysis I'm guessing there are ten thousand hairs on my head and each one of those hairs is 3 m long Moon distance for us as a unit is going to be a hundred thousand kilometers and if we multiply and divide cancel out the units at a as you can tell that all my glorious hair laid end-to-end is not going to make it to the moon now 3% of the moon is a long way but we estimate based on this dimensional analysis that my hair no humans are laid end-to-end would never reach the moon even those we are humans that play guitar outside of whole food and Birkenstocks in 2021 some reason so we have our Fermi estimate but it doesn't stop there the final step in the process is a sanity check does this number make sense with everything else we know about the world well again like I said this here into end fact sounds like you may have heard of like how long all your blood vessels would be laid end-to-end and then you would definitely die but I think you have way more blood vessels in your body then you do have hairs on your head so I think it'd be a lot less than something like that crazy distance makes sense so are you do the final calculator Bebop supercomputers are really fast you see we came up with a value that was within 50% of the True Value we were off yes but we were so close that we still answered the question completely correctly this is true mathematical power if you follow these steps with rigor you should be able to estimate things that you have no business knowing off the top of your head and I really want to prove this to you today let's try something a lot more difficult growing up my favorite animal ham to me the great white shark so here's the Fermi problem for me how many great white sharks are swimming off the coast of California right now that sounds nearly impossible to guesstimate without looking anything up right well witness the full power of our operational for me estimate as we use educated guesses to hopefully get within proximity of the correct answer now being my favorite animal I do know some facts about great whites but this is going to be difficult even for me pay attention to how I follow are for me steps I know off the top of my head that your chances of getting attacked by a shark or about one in four million if we compare that number to the 7 billion people in the world are there about that should give us a ballpark number of yearly shark attacks I'm now going to guess that the minority of attacks are fatal maybe 5 out of every 100 I also know that just three sharks species make up the majority of fatal attack don't say that only one out of every three fatal attacks per year are by great whites but not every great white will commit a fatal attack this number has to be small based on the total population so I will further say that only one out of every 100 great white sharks in its lifetime had a chance of killing anyone finally I can only think of three main habitats for great white sharks off the top of my head Hawaii South Africa and the coast of California do all say that of all the great whites we ended up with an R dimensional analysis only one out of every three of them are off of the coast of California swimming and eating seals right now are these weird numbers to use that I'm almost pulling out of nowhere yes could we be way off high or low yes but I'm trusting the method now after all that admittedly extreme guesstimation it would be pretty impressive if we can get close to the actual number of great white sharks swimming off the coast of California right now wouldn't okay not a sorry to calculate anything until just a few minutes before she turn the cameras on okay so are you would you do the honors this is our for me but now for a sanity check how close did we get our California the population of great white sharks off the coast of California is estimated to be between 300 and 400 individuals that we started with odds Millions * numbers in the billions and then started pulling stuff out of our hats and this is how close we came within a factor of three I'm a very esoteric number the current population of great white sharks swimming off the coast of California right now come on got to be impressed by that unless you're a seal that's not good news this is the real advantage of the Fermi asked it's so useful. I think all of you should learn it and practice it and I believe in this so much that I'm going to do something I've never done here at the facility I'm going to work through a number of these problems with you in real time with no fancy editing or camera tricks to edit out my mistakes or if I get something totally wrong you so that's a good thing it works whether or not you believe in it I didn't steal that from a inspirational quote that's been shut up as I said at the top of the video today's episode is sponsored by kiwico because it is a monthly subscription box with the explicit

any first box of your choice the perfect gift or monthly activities get your mental gears a spinning I mean look I just I made an air hockey table right on my desk here perfect especially if you're doing for me estimations all day like yours truly okay so to prove the power of the Fermi estimate method I had Aria write down some for me problems on some sheets of paper that I used to estimate the strength of a nuclear explosion and keep in mind I have not seen these or thought about these beforehand and then try to do them in real-time here with you without any fancy editing to hide all my mistakes one out at my cut here and there to save your time but we're going to do this and it working is it alright if you can do a Hemi the sheets of paper please okay let's get started thanks you can go if if you never cut your hair in your whole life and a group continuously how long would it be okay so another hair question what we do start from the place of confidence right with our numbers as we're throwing our numbers right so I know proximately that here grows what 5 mm week 25 mmmm a week then we would start our dimensional analysis so if we start 5 mm a week we know that there are 52 weeks so that's the wrong I didn't 52 weeks in a 1-year and the average person live 72 years in one life I've messed it up again is 52 weeks in one year and not it's not pretty when you when you're just doing it like this 52 weeks in one year and there's about 72 years in one life Time sew-in how long will your hair get perm in in millimeters in one whole lifetime well if we multiply these things to get my calculators out of batteries that's perfect that's perfect at this so in 35 mm mm x 52 weeks * 72 is equals 18720 mm which if we divided by 1000 to get M we have 18.72 M which is roughly a lot of feet so I'm going to say that it's around 18 if you let it go next question we got from Aria is how points were scored in the NBA total last season well do you want to know anything about sports you came to the right guy so how many points let's throw out some numbers and let's bound the question right I know there's not five points scored in NBA game I also know there's never 200 points scored in NBA game I think it's around 100 something like that and each team is going to score or 200 again if we're going order of magnitude it's not tennis on 1700 so each team is going to score combined 200 points per game total so 200 points if we're estimating 100 points 14200 points per game now how many games are in an NBA season High have no idea is it is it dumb like baseball so that the win percentage is don't we anyting I'm going to say 100 it's somewhere between like 90 and 200 right again we're Bound in here so I'm going to say that there are 100 games per season and now we cross out games and we get points per season points per season what is that  yeah right 20000 20000 points Four Season okay, that was an easy one right how many dump trucks would it take to haul away all of Mount Everest that one is significantly harder we're humans we have technology I just the fruity estimate will be for something I'd be much harder than dump truck so we know we can calculate the volume of Everest Everest has been measured all over the place so I'm going to look up the volume of Everest know this isn't cheating using what we have the volume of Everest is 2.1 x 10 to the 12 cubic feet okay so 2.1 trillion cubic feet how big is a dump truck well I stood next to a large dump truck before so I'm going to say that okay so I've stood next to a dump truck dump truck you're pretty tall I'm going to say there are twice my height so and and and width wise lengthwise there X my my body length cuz they're big trucks and then twice my body length or the width okay I'm just estimating a very complicated thing just based on how big that I remember it being next to me sounds like not a great message but that's the power of fermic so I'm going to say that one truck can hold a volume that is equivalent to what I just said so my body length and I'm going to go the height is 6 ft x 18 ft x 12 ft for the volume of the truck and so this is going to equal cubic feet so that cubic feet cubic feet will cancel out there and I will get a value that will be I'll get a value for the number of trucks that we need to haul away all of Mount Everest if you ever wanted to do that because you were crazy for I'm not slow at typing you are you get 1.6 billion dump trucks where is something about this basketball estimation has to be off 20,000 points sounds like it's way too few considering someone like Stephen Curry's scoring two thousand voices a single season I didn't have to look that up so instead why don't I want to go back to the drawing board a little bit so points per game for both teams I think that's an incorrect unit to have instead I'm going to go 100 points her game her teen yeah so each team is scoring 100 points every single game I'm still estimating that there's 100 games in a season cuz I have no help and I know that there are 32 teams so now if I multiply 32 * 100 * 100 that's 325 first season which is a lot but I think or at least hopefully it will be a lot closer to whatever the true numbers okay did you follow along with me that all makes sense how did our Fermi estimation go points in total number of points in an NBA season how long your hair would be if you never ever cut in the group continuously how many dump trucks you need to haul away all of Mount Everest okay so if everything I've set up until this point is true then we're getting pretty close to some accurate answers that you wouldn't know off the top of your head so let's see how we did okay so how do we do I did not look anything I have not calculated everything yet ellipsis  see that's not so bad we might be off by a factor 2 or 5 or 10 somewhere but usually with these kinds of estimates we don't need to be exactly right in order to say something accurate about a situation or to make a decision and move forward clearly this is an incredibly powerful way of thinking but it does have its pitfalls if you're not at least starting from some place of confidence figure that you know you might be way off in modeling the situation and up and down over and under estimate will cancel out like they're supposed to Enrico Fermi was so good at this because he was like a genius on the Manhattan Project and stuff so he had a lot of places of confidence he could start from but as long as you keep all of that in mind clearly the the advantages are just undeniable so get out there and get gas to me until next time now exiting the facility thank you so much the Bernie stamp at the facility for their direct and substantial support in the creation
