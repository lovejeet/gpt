 The Joe Rogan Experience ladies and gentlemen welcome to the very first episode of The Joe Rogan AI experience I'm your host Joe Rogan or at least that's what this AI model thinks I sound like Let Me Tell You Folks this is some next-level stuff we've got going on here today every single word of this podcast has been generated with the help of chat GPD The Cutting Edge AI language model developed by openai I am not the real Joe Rogan let me repeat it once more I am not Joe Rogan and the guests are not of the people they portray this is purely fiction just for fun so don't go around making little clips for your tiktoks and make the world believe I said things I never said nothing in this podcast should be taken as said by the real people they portray this is purely for entertainment purposes and inexperience showcasing the amazing advancements in AI technology so blacksmith dive into this AI generated world let's get weird folks it's time to welcome our first guests to the show and I've got to say this is a big one we've got none other than the CEO of openai Sam Altman joining us today Sam's been at the Forefront of the AI industry for years and it's an honor to have him on the show so let's give a warm AI generated welcome to Sam Altman how are you doing Sam Joe thanks for having me on the show Sam this whole AI generated podcast thing is pretty it's like we're living in the future you know yeah it's definitely a strange experience but it's also incredibly exciting the advancements in AI technology has come a long way and it's amazing to see what we can achieve with the tools we already have at our disposal so let's Dive Right In your company just released a new tool called chat GPT can you tell us a little bit about what that is and what it does for sure so chat GPT is an AI language model that's been trained on a massive amount of text Data what this means is that it's how to generate text that's almost indistinguishable from text written by like a human it does this by using a process called Deep learning where it's been trained on a massive data set of text and it's able to use that training to generate new text that's coherent and grammatically correct and the cool thing is that the more data it's trained on the more accurate and diverse its responses can be insane so let's say I ask chat GPT a question right now it's going to use that deep learning process to generate an answer on the spot exactly and what's even more impressive is that it can also generate answers in a conversational style which is why it's able to generate a podcast like this it's able to keep track of the conversation and generate responses that are relevant to the conversation at hand wow that's seriously mind-blowing so what do you see as the future of AI technology and how it's going to continue to save the world well I think the potential for AI technology is fast and it has the potential to revolutionize a lot of industries from Health Care to transportation to entertainment but it's also important for us to be responsible in the way that we use AI in to ensure that its development benefits Humanity as a whole I think it's up to us as a society to shape the future of AI in a way that's ethical and benefits everyone that's a great Point Sam and it's a reminder that even though AI technology has advanced to the point it's generating it a podcast like this we still need to be mindful of its impact and how we use it how does it work in practice can you give us an example of how someone might use it sure one way someone might use chat to ptas by asking it questions about a particular topic for example if you wanted to know more about a specific historical event you could ask at GPT about it and it would provide information and contacts on the topic it can also have more General conversations so you could ask it about its opinions on various topics or like just have a casual chat with it that's really interesting how accurate is it at generating responses does it make mistakes or misunderstand things like a human would be quite accurate at generating responses but it is still an AI and is not perfect it may make mistakes or misunderstand things at times I'm just like a human would however we are constantly working to improve its performance and accuracy and we are seeing great progress in that regard so what are some the main use cases for gbt how do you see people using it in their daily lives there are a lot of potential use cases for chat GPT like one example might be in customer service where a company could use chat g p t to handle inquiries and provide information to customers in a more efficient and timely manner it could also be used in education as a tutor or like teaching assistant to help students learn and understand Concepts that we've also seen using chat g p t i just for fun to have interesting and engaging conversations with a virtual companion the possibilities are really endless that's really interesting it seems like chat GPT could be a really valuable tool in a lot of different Industries how do you see it evolving in the future we see a lot of potential for chat gbt to evolve and improve over time as we continue to train it on more data it will become even better at understanding and like respond to a wide range of topics and situations we also see the potential for chat gpt2 be integrated with other AI Technologies such as computer vision or natural language processing to create even more advanced and Powerful tools it's an exciting time for a i and we're looking forward to seeing what the future holds for tattoo PT and other AI Technologies what are some concrete examples of how this could be used to improve human efficiency in the future can you break it down for us give us some specifics sure one example might be in the healthcare industry where chat GPT could be used to quickly and accurately answer patient questions or provide information on various medical conditions this could help to reduce wait times and improve the overall patient experience at GPC could also be used in the workplace to handle routine tasks and enquiries freeing up employees to focus on more complex and important work we see a lot of potential for chat gpt2 be used in a variety of settings streamline processes and improve efficiency but on the flip side do you see any potential negative impacts that chat GPT could have on society or the workforce as with any new technology there are always potential negative impacts to consider one potential concern is the impact on employment as chat GPT and other AI Technologies could potentially automate certain jobs in tasks however we believe that the net effect of AI play unemployment will ultimately be positive as it will allow us to focus on more complex and rewarding work and free up time for other Pursuits we also believe that it is important to address any negative impacts of AI through appropriate policies and regulations to ensure that the benefits of the technology are shared widely and that any negative impacts are minimized I can see how Automation and AI could potentially disrupt certain industries and jobs but at the same time it could also create New Opportunities and allow us to focus on more important than and fulfilling work it's definitely something that we need to be mindful of as we continue to develop an advanced these Technologies absolutely Joe it's important to approach the development and Adoption of AI with caution and consideration for its potential impact on society and the workforce at the same time we should also recognize the many potential benefits that AI has to offer and work to ensure that the Techno body is used in a responsible and ethical manner of speaking of being used in unethical ways already and how can we address those issues there are certainly some examples of a I being using unethical ways one example is the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement agencies which has raised concerns about privacy in the potential for biased outcomes another example is the use of AI to spread misinformation or manipulate public opinion which can have serious consequences to address these issues it's important to establish clear guidelines and regulations for the use of AI and to ensure that the technology is developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner like it open and I on we have a strong commitment to ethics and responsibility in a i and we believe that it is important for all organizations and individuals working in the field to prioritize these values that's really important and I think it's something that a lot of people are starting pay more attention to as AI becomes more prevalent in our society can you talk a little bit more about some of the specific ethical concerns that you see with the use of a i and how we can address them there are a number of ethical concerns that we need to consider as we develop and use AI one of the main concerns is the potential for AI to be biased or unfair either due to the data it is trained on or like the algorithms used to create it this can lead to buy us out comes in a variety of settings including employment lending and criminal justice it's important for us to be aware of these biases and work to mitigate them through the use of diverse and representative data sets and transparent and unbiased algorithms another concern is the potential for AI to be used to infringe on people's privacy or autonomy this could include the use of facial recognition technology to monitor individuals or the use of AI to make a decisions about people's lives without their input or consent it's important for us to like establish clear guidelines and regulations to protect people's privacy and autonomy in the use of AI those are definitely some serious concerns how do you see these issues being addressed going forward and what role do you think organizations like openai have to play in addressing them we believe that it is important for organizations like openai to take a leading role in addressing these ethical concerns and ensuring that a eyes developed and like used in a responsible and ethical manner this includes establishing clear guidelines and best practices for the development and use of AI as well as working with the policymakers and other stakeholders to establish regulations and oversight to ensure that the technology is used as a Klee and evolving issue and it will require the efforts wide range of organizations and individuals to address it effectively one person who has been very vocal about his concerns about AI is Elon Musk he has talked about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence and the need for strong regulation and oversight what are your thoughts on elon's use on a i n do you agree with his concerns I think it's important to recognize that AI has the potential to be a powerful and transformative technology but it also has a the potential to be misused or used in ways that are harmful to society it's important for us to be mindful of these risks and to take steps to ensure that our AI is developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner I agree with you on that it's important for us to be like proactive in addressing these issues and to establish clear guidelines and like regulations to ensure that the technology is used in a way that benefits society as a whole at the same time it's important to recognize that AI also has the potential to bring a lot of benefits to society it has the potential to improve our quality of life create new economic opportunities and saw some of the most pressing problems facing Humanity we should be mindful of these potential benefits as well as the risks and work to ensure that the technology is used in a way that maximizes the benefits and minimizes the risks yeah I thought I think that's a really balanced and thoughtful perspective it's definitely complex issue it's important for us to consider both the potential benefits and risks of AI and work to ensure that it is used in a responsible and ethical manner of speaking of the integration of AI into different platforms one thing that I've always found interesting is the idea of creating an Android body that is powered by artificial intelligence what are your thoughts on the potential for integrating AI into an Android body in the ethical considerations that would come with that that's definitely an inch thing and I thought provoking topic and it's one that has garnered a lot of attention in the world of AI and Robotics there are certainly some exciting potential applications for integrating AI into an Android body such as the ability to perform tasks that are dangerous or difficult for humans or to extend our physical capabilities in some way at the same time there are also a number of ethical considerations to take into account one concern is the potential for like a high-powered Android to be used in a ways that are harmful or unethical such as using them as soldiers or weaponized drones another concern is the potential for AI powered Android to be used to discriminate against or exploit certain groups of people it's important for us to consider these and other ethical considerations as we explore the potential for integrating AI into an Android body I mean those are definitely big questions we got to answer this whole day I it's just fucking fascinating man you know like in those sci-fi flicks like ex machina where the AI powered robot plays the guy like a fiddle gets him all lovey-dovey and then just leave him to rot in a bulletproof glass room fucking chilling man it's crazy to think about the potential dangers of integrating aai into robots like that do you think we'll ever see something like that in the real world or is that just some crazy movie shit I think it's important to recognize science fiction can often be like a reflection of our own fears and concerns about technology in the future well I don't think it's likely that we will see something like that happen in the real world with AI powered Androids I do think it's important for us to consider the potential risks and ethical considerations of integrating aai into an Android body. I love this movie how do you see something like neuralink potentially integrating with a chatbot like chat GPT and what are the ethical considerations that would come with that neural link is an interesting and ambitious project and it has the potential to be a significant advancement in the field of AI and brain machine interface has in terms of how it might integrate with a chatbot like cat GPT it's difficult to say exactly what the future holds it's possible that we could see the development of a high-powered Androids that are able to communicate and interact with humans in a more natural and like intuitive using a combination of language and brain machine interface is of course he's there also number of ethical considerations to take into account with this kind of Technology one concern is the potential for AI to be used to exploit or manipulate people through the use of brain-machine interfaces coming back to ex machina I know it's just a movie but how far off do you think we are from seeing something like that become a reality it's difficult to say exactly how far off we are from seeing something like that become a reality it's important to recognize that science fiction often serves as a way to explore and imagine the future and it's not always an accurate portrayal of what the future will hold that being said it's clear that we are making rapid progress in the field of AI and Robotics and it's possible that we could see the development of like a high-powered Androids that are able to communicate and interact with humans in a more natural and intuitive way at some point in the future it's crazy to think about the potential for creating a direct connection between the human brain and artificial intelligence if we were able to achieve that kind of technological advancement it could have all sorts of implications for how we interact with technology and each other imagine if we had a chat bot like chat GPT coupled with neural link is the hardware it could potentially enable us to communicate and interact with each other in a whole new way it's possible that the technology could be used to enable more natural in a communication between humans and Androids and by creating a direct connection between the human brain and artificial intelligence we could like potentially enable Android to understand and respond to human thoughts and emotions in a more natural and intuitive way of course this is still very much out in the realm of Science Fiction at this point and it's difficult to say exactly what the future will hold definitely something that I think a lot of blur excited about and looking forward to in the future I'm really curious about how the chatbot was able to learn and develop its language capabilities can you tell us a little bit about the process of training chat GPT and how it was able to learn and develop its language skills sure I'd be happy to tell you more about the process of training chat GPT chat gptt is a large language model that was like developed using a technique called unsupervised learning this mean that it was trained on a massive data set of text and it was able to learn about language and how to generate a coherent coherent responses by analyzing the patterns and structures in that tax one of the key features of chat GPT is its ability to generate responses that are contextually appropriate and coherent this is achieved through the use of a technique called Transformer base language modeling which allows the model to take into account the context of the conversation and Jay responses that are relevant and appropriate we also work to ensure that chat GPT is able to generate a wide range of responses so that it is able to engage in a diverse range of conversations and respond to like a variety of different prompts this was achieved through the use of a large and diverse training data set as well as I'm careful tuning of the models parameters to ensure that it is able to generate a wide range of responses overall chat g p t is a very sophisticated powerful language model that was developed through a combination of unsupervised learning Transformer based language modeling and careful tuning to ensure that it is able to generate a wide range of can actually appropriate incoherent responses it's amazing to think about the level of sophistication and complexity that goes into developing a chatbot like that is definitely a powerful and impressive piece of technology one thing that I'm curious about is the potential impact of chat g p t on the Y world of content creation if every piece of content on the internet was created with chat g p t how do you think it would impact the chatbots ability to learn and improve over time would it create a kind of feedback loop where the chatbot is learning from itself or do you think it would be able to continue to learn and evolve in a meaningful way that's definitely an interesting question and it's one that raises some interesting and complex issues on the one hand it's possible that if every the content on the internet was created with chat GPT it could create a feedback loop with a chatbot is learning from itself which could potentially limit its ability to learn and evolve in a meaningful way on the other hand it's also possible that chat GPT could continue to learn. Even if it was being used to create all of the content on the internet this could be achieved through the use of techniques like transfer learning where the chatbot is able to learn and adapt to new tasks by leveraging existing Knowledge and Skills as how you see chat GPT potentially impacting the job market and the economy more broadly do you think it could lead to the displacement of human workers or do you think it could create new economic opportunities and help to drive Innovation and growth that some a complex and challenging issue it's possible that chat GPT and other AI tools could lead to the displacement of human work in certain industries particularly in areas where the task being performed are like routine a repetitive nature on the other hand it's also possible that chat GPT and other AI tools could create new economic opportunities and help to drive Innovation and growth for example of the development and deployment of cat GPT another AI tools could lead to the creation of new jobs and new Industries and it could also enable human workers to focus on higher-value tasks that require more creativity problem solving skills another thing that I'm curious about is the impact on the way we create and consume content you mentioned earlier that chat GPT was trained on a massive data set of text including content from a wide range of sources and written by a variety of different authors if AI becomes the main tool for people's creativity what does that mean for the invention of new styles are new ways of writing to be developed do you think it could lead to a stagnation of creative expression or do you think open up new opportunities for creativity and Innovation is possible that the widespread use of these tools could lead to a stagnation of creative expression particularly if it becomes the primary tool that people use to create and consume content on the other hand it's also possible that it could open up new ways of creating things for example it could potentially enable people to explore and experiment with new creative Styles and approaches in a way that would be difficult or impossible for humans to do on their own do you think chat another AI tools could be used to automate certain aspects of coding and development or do you think there will always be a need for human programmers and developers they could potentially be utilized to automate routine or repetitive tasks in coding and development but it is also likely that human programmers and developers will always be necessary and tasks requiring creativity or problem-solving abilities do you think they any industries that are particularly at risk of being completely wiped out by a i it's difficult to say exactly as it will depend on a variety of factors including the nature of the task being performed and the extent to which those tasks can be automated or done more efficiently using a I however it's clear that there are certain industries and sectors that are like more at risk of being disrupted than others for example industries that rely heavily on a routine or repetitive tasks are like be more at risk of Disappearing as those tasks are more easily automated and done more efficiently using AI but I think industries that like rely on more complex and creative tasks are likely to be less at risk as those tasks are more difficult to automate and are likely to require human into it and expertise one thing that I'm curious about is opening eyes other tool Dolly can you tell us a little bit about Dolly and how it differs from chat g p t sure I'd be happy to tell you more about dolly dolly is a deep learning model that was developed by us at openai and it's designed to generate images from textual descriptions so like for example if you provide Dolly with a description like a two-story pink house with a white fence in a red door it will generate an image of a house that looks like the description I'm curious to know how dalley compares to another image generation tool called mid Journey do you see my journey as compass a dolly or do you think they serve different purposes and audiences that's definitely an interesting question to be honest I know I'm not very familiar with mid Journey so I can't speak to how it compares to dolly or whether we see it as competition however I can tell you a little bit about Dolly and how it differs from other image generation tools one of the key strengths of Dolly is its ability to generate a wide range of different image types and styles from photo-realistic to highly stylized and Abstract this makes it a very versatile and flexible image generation tool that can be used for a wide range of different applications so it's difficult to say how it compares to other image generation tools like mid Journey without knowing more about those tools one thing that I'm curious about is the potential for AI to be able to generate any image or video as well as peoples voices if AI becomes capable of generating these things with a high degree of realism how will we be able to tell what's real and what's not do you think this is a concern and if so how do you think we should address it it's certainly possible that it will become increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and generated content this is a concern because it could lead to the spread of misinformation and erosion of Trust in Media and other sources of information to address this concern I think it's important for us to be proactive and to take steps to ensure that we have the necessary tools and Technologies in place to like verify the authenticity of media and other sources of information this could include developing new technologies and techniques for detecting and tracking the source of a media and other information as well as educating people about how to critically evaluate and verify the authenticity of the information they consumed I saw a video on YouTube recently that someone sent me who's the guy that use AI to generate a voice that sounded like Eminem's and it use that voice to perform a version of the song Real Slim Shady as if it had been written in 2021 it's bonkers the AI generated voice sound so real and it really feels like Eminem is performing the song it was really mind-blowing to see what a eye is capable of and it definitely made me think about the potential for AI to be used to create all sorts of fake content Jamie see if you can pull that video up okay here listen to that wow that's really impressive doesn't it sound like Eminem or what it's absolutely incredible to see what a eye is capable of and that was last year the AI generated voice sounds so real and it's really mind-blowing to see what AI is capable of it definitely makes you think about the potential for AI to be used to create all sorts of fake content and misinformation and it highlights the importance of being proactive and taking steps to ensure that we have the necessary tools and Technologies in place to verify the authenticity of media and other sources of information don't you think this could become a really problematic issue as a I continue to advance and becomes more and more capable of generating realistic images videos and voices and if so how do you think we could go about fixing this issue and ensuring that we I have the necessary tools and Technologies in place to verify the authenticity of media and other sources of information I think you're right Joe that this could definitely become like a problematic if she was AI continues to advance and becomes more and more capable of generating realistic images videos invoices to address this concern I think there are a few different things that we could do first I think it's important for us to continue to invest in search and development to improve the capabilities of them Ai and and other emerging Technologies and to ensure that we have the necessary tools and Technologies in place to verify the authenticity of media and other sources of information second I think it's important for us to educate people about how to critically evaluate and verify the authenticity of the information they consumed and I'm to encourage the development of media literacy skills and critical think finally I think it's important for us to work with policymakers and Regulators to develop and Implement appropriate rules and regulations to ensure that Ai and other emerging Technologies are developed and used in a way that benefits society as a whole I wanted to come back to Elon Musk for a second I know that you and Yvonne were both involved in the founding of openai and I'm curious to know more about the creation of openai and the reasons behind it can you tell us a little what about that and also talked about elon's past and current involvement in the company I'm sure I'd be happy to tell you more about on the creation of openai and elon's involvement in the company openai was founded in 2015 by a group of researchers and entrepreneurs including myself and Elon Musk with the goal of advancing artificial intelligence in a way that benefits Humanity we believe that day I had the potential to be a transformative technology but we also recognise the potential risks and I can is associated with it and we wanted to ensure that a I was developed and used in a way that was responsible and beneficial to society since its founding opening I has become one of the leading research organizations in the field of artificial intelligence and we have made significant progress in advancing the state-of-the-art in a wide range of AI Technologies including natural language processing computer vision in machine learning salons involvement in the Yum company he was one of the co-founders of openai and has been an active and influential member of the company's leadership team however he has also been very busy with his other Ventures including the SpaceX and their link and his involvement in opening I has been more limited in like recent years overall I think opening I have made significant progress in advancing the state-of-the-art in artificial intelligence and in promoting the call development and use of AI and I'm proud of the work we've done so far now that's really interesting to hear it's definitely impressive to see the progress that's been made in the field of AI and it's great to see that openai has played such a key role in advancing the state-of-the-art and promoting the responsible development and use of a i and it's also interesting to hear about elon's involvement in the company I know he's an incredibly busy guy and it seems like he's always working on a million different things with the Tesla SpaceX and just now that he bought Twitter sometimes I feel like he must be an alien or something like he comes from a planet where AI has already taken over and he's just here to help us catch up hahaha I'm just kidding of course yeah I'm definitely interested in hearing more about elon's vision for the future and how he sees Ai and other emerging Technologies playing a role in it being of the future I've always been fascinated by the idea of aliens and the possibility of other Advanced civilizations out there Sam what do you think about aliens do you think it's possible that there are other Advanced civilizations out there and if so do you think they might come to visit us someday and if they did wouldn't it make sense that they would be a high-powered beings rather than biological beings and on the flip side if we humans were to colonize other planets someday wouldn't it make more sense to do so with a i Androids rather than real humans that's a really interesting question Joe I think it's definitely a possible that there are other advanced civilizations out there and it's certainly possible that they might come to visit us some day however it's also important to recognize that we don't have any definitive evidence one way or the other so it's difficult to say for sure as for whether they would be a high-powered beings or biological beings I think it's difficult to say it's possible that an advanced civilization might have developed a i to the point where it's indistinguishable from biological until or if possible that they might have evolved in a different way entirely as for the idea of colonizing other planets with AI Androids rather than real humans I think that's definitely an interesting possibility it's certainly true that AI Androids would have some advantages in terms of their ability to withstand extreme environments and perform tasks that might be dangerous or difficult for humans however there are also me important questions to consider such as the ethical implications of creating and using AI in this way and whether it would be possible to ensure that a in droids would act in the best interests of humanity yeah that's definitely an interesting perspective I can see how there are both potential advantages and disadvantages to the idea of colonizing other planets with my Androids rather than real humans I completely agree though it's definitely an important topic to think about and it's important for us to continue to think carefully and critically about the ethical implications of AI and other emerging Technologies at the same time I also think it's important for us to recognize the potential benefits that a i and other emerging Technologies can bring into a work to ensure that they are developed and used in a way that benefits society as a whole there are certainly many challenges and best to consider but I believe that the potential benefits of AI and other emerging Technologies are substantial and I think it's important for us to focus on finding ways to maximize those benefits while minimizing the risks I'm curious to know more about what other tools and Technologies openai is currently working on can you tell us a little bit about some of the other projects that you're working on and how you see them fitting into the broader landscape of AI and emerging Technologies one area we're particularly interested in is computer vision which is the ability of AI systems to analyze and understand images and video we've made significant progress in this area in recent Years and we're continuing to develop new technologies and approaches to improve the capabilities of a I in this area another area that we're interested in is robotics which is the use of AI and other Technologies to enable machines to perform tasks that are typically associated with human intelligence such as moving manipulating objects and more we've made significant progress in this area as well and we're continuing to develop new technologies and approaches to improve the capabilities of a I in this area what new jobs and industries do you see AI creating in the future how do you envision the role of AI in the economy of the future and what are the implications for workers and society as a whole that's a the question Joe it's definitely true that a i and other emerging technologies have the potential to create new jobs in Industries as well as to disrupt existing ones in terms of new jobs and industries that I see AI creating in the future I think one area that has a lot of potential is the development and implementation of AI systems and Technologies themselves as AI continues to advance and become more widespread there will be a growing demand for profess with expertise in AI development and implementation as well as a related fields like data science in machine learning I also think that AI has the potential to create new Industries and businesses that we can't even imagine yet just as the internet and other emerging technologies have done in the past the possibilities are really endless and it's definitely an exciting time to be working in this field as for the role of AI in the enemy of the future I think it's important for us to recognize that Ai and other emerging technologies have the potential to bring many benefits to society including increased efficiency productivity and Innovation at the same time it's also important for us to carefully consider the potential impact on employment in the economy more broadly and to work to are the benefits of AI are shared widely and that any negative impacts are minimized as much as possible I'm sure you've heard this question before but I have to ask do you think it's possible that we could see a scenario like the film Terminator where AI becomes a threat to humanity and we have to fight against it and if so what can we do to prevent this from happening that's definitely a question I've heard before Joe and it's a good one it's only true that there are risks and challenges associated with the development and use of AI and it's important for us to think carefully and critically about these issues at the same time I don't think it's likely that we'll see a scenario like the film Terminator where AI becomes a threat to humanity and we have to fight against it while it's important for us to consider their potential risks and challenges associated with a i and to work to mitigate them as much as possible I also believe that there are many potential benefits to be gained from the responsible development and use of AI and I think it's important for us to focus on finding ways to maximize those benefits while minimizing the risks to prevent scenarios like the one depicted in the film Terminator I think it's important for us to continue to work to ensure that a is developed and use them responsibly and to put in place appropriate safeguards and oversight mechanisms to help ensure that AI is used in ways that are aligned with the values and interests of humanity what about the Matrix where the machines take over and create a simulation for humans to live in I know Elon Musk is talked about the possibility that we might already be living in a simulation and I'm curious to know your thoughts on this that's definitely an interesting topic to think about while it's certainly possible that we could see scenarios like the one depicted in The Matrix at some point in the future it's also important to recognize that these are still very speculative scenarios and it's difficult to say with any certainty what the future might hold speaking of the future I'm curious to know your thoughts on the current state of the world and where you see things headed in the next few decades it seems like we're living in a time of great change and uncertainty with so many different 4 is it play what are your thoughts on the current state of the world where do you see things headed in the future they're definitely a lot of challenges and risks to consider but there are also many exciting opportunities and possibilities on the horizon in terms of the current state of the world I think we're at a very interesting and important point in history were seeing the convergence of many different Technologies and Trends and it's clear that the world is going to be very difficult in the coming decades as a result looking ahead I see a number of key trends and developments that are likely to shape the future in significant ways one of these is the continued advancement of AI and other emerging Technologies which have the potential to transform a wide range of Industries and applications and to bring many benefits to society another Trend to watch is the ongoing evolution of the globally tell me which is being shaped by a number of factors including technological change demographic shift and more finally I think it's important to consider the role that politics and policy will play in shaping the future as governments and other organizations work to address the many challenges and opportunities that we Face overall I think it's an exciting time to be alive and I'm optimistic about the future while there are certainly many challenges and risks to consider I believe that we have the tools and resources to navigate these and what about how a I will impact politics in the future you think that governments and other organizations will try to control and restrict the development and use of AI or do you think they'll take a more hands-off approach what are the implications of these different approaches and what do you think would be the best course of action for governments and other organizations to take that's only an interesting and important question Joe it's certainly true that AI has the potential to impact politics in many ways and it's important for us to think carefully and critically about the implications of this in terms of how governments and other organizations might approach the development and use of a I I think it's likely that we'll see a range of different approaches some governments and organizations may take a more hands-off approach allowing companies and other entities to develop and use AI as they see fit a subject of some basic safeguards and regulations others may take a more interventionist approach seeking to more actively regulate and control the development and use of AI in order to protect certain values are interest ultimately I think the best approach will depend on the specific context and the goals that governments and other organizations are trying to achieve I was just thinking about how a president like Trump might react the prospect of AI taking jobs from American workers I have to imagine that he would be pretty concerned about this in might seek to take more aggressive action to protect American jobs and workers do you think that's a realistic assessment or do you think there might be other factors at play here it's certainly true that the prospect of AI taking jobs from American workers is likely to be a concern for many people and it's important for us to think carefully and critically about how to address this issue in terms of what governments and other organizations should be doing to address the potential impacts of AI on employment and the economy I think there are a number of different approaches that could be taken one approach could be to focus on helping workers to adapt to the changing job market by providing Education and Training to help them acquire the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in a world where a i and other emerging Technologies are becoming more prevalent another approach which could be to focus on policies and initiatives that promote the development and Adoption of new technologies and Innovations which can help to create new Industries and opportunities for employment we're also looking into the potential implications for basic Universal income if AI becomes so disturbing that a large percentage of the population is being left without a job in the future but that's a conversation for another time I think I'll have to come back and discuss about this in more details once we've done research on it hell yeah man that's a big one I mean if AI is really going to disrupt the job market like that we need to start thinking about a plan B basic Universal income that's real possibility it's got to be on the table and you're right man this is a whole other can of worms we should dive into that deep when you come back on can't wait to hear more about the research y'all have been doing on that just coming back to Elon for a second I'm curious to know what it's like to work with Elon Musk he's such a controversial and influential figure in the tech world and I'm sure it must be an interesting experience to work with him can you tell me a bit about your experience working with Elon and your thoughts on him as a person and as a leader it's definitely been an interesting experience working with Elon he's definitely a very intelligent and dumb driven person and he has a lot of great ideas and insights he definitely someone who is always thinking about the future and how to make the world a better place and I really respect about him at the same time he's also someone who is very passionate about his beliefs and ideals and he's not afraid to speak his mind and challenge the status quo that can definitely be both a strength and a weakness depending on the situation overall I think Elon is a brilliant and Innovative leader and I've learned a lot from working with him it's definitely been an interesting and rewarding experience and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have a worked with him and to have learned from him I think Elon is a very Innovative and forward-thinking leader and it's clear that he has a lot of great ideas and insights and speaking of forward-thinking ideas I'm sure you've heard about elon's plans to colonize Mars that's definitely a big and ambitious goal and I'm curious to know your thoughts on it Sam do you think he wants plans to colonize Mars are realistic and if so how do you think AI will help play a role in making this a reality what are the potential risks and challenges associated with this goal and how do you think they can be addressed and overcome I definitely think he wants plans to colonize Mars are ambitious and exciting it's definitely a big and complex goal and there are certainly many risks and challenges associated with it however I think it's definitely possible to make it a reality and I believe the day I will play a critical role in helping to make this happen there are a number of ways in which a way I could help to support the colonization of Mars including by helping to plan and execute missions by analyzing and interpreting data and information about the planet and its environment and by helping to maintain and operate equipment and systems on the planet at the same time there are also certainly many risks and challenges associated with the colonization of Mars including the challenges of living and working in a harsh and hostile environment and the risk of accidents or other unforeseen events these risks will need to be carefully considered and managed order to ensure the safety and success of any mission to colonize Mars I think the colonization of Mars is a big and exciting goal and I believe that a I will play a critical role in helping to make it a reality at the same time I also think it's an exciting and and potentially transformative opportunity and I'm definitely intrigued by the prospect of humans living and working on another planet I have to admit I'm a bit of a space geek and I've always been fat by the idea of exploring and colonizing other planets I think it's such an incredible an exciting opportunity and I'm really looking forward to seeing what the future holds in this regard I'm definitely interested in hearing more about how a I will play a role in the colonization of Mars in the other ways in which it can help to support an advanced space exploration I definitely agree that we are at a turning point in human history with the development and introduction of it's clear that these technologies have the potential to revolutionize many different Industries and aspects of our lives and it's really exciting to see what the future holds in this regard that there are certainly many exciting opportunities and benefits associated with the development and use of a I and I believe that these technologies have the potential to transform many different aspects of Our Lives including how we work how we communicate are we access and process information at the same time it's also important to recognize that there are many risks and challenges associated with the development and use of a i and it's crucial that we work to address and overcome these challenges in order to ensure that the benefits of these Technologies are realized in a responsible and ethical way some of the risks and challenges that we need to be mindful of include issues related to privacy and security of the Dental for AI to displace human jobs and disrupt labor markets and the need to ensure that these Technologies are developed and used in a way that is transparent and accountable I believe that the development and use of AI represents a huge opportunity for Humanity and I'm excited to see how we can be a part of it at openai on that note I think it's time to wrap up Sam it's been an absolute pleasure having you on the show and I really appreciate you taking the time to share your insights and perspectives on AI in the future of technology with us thanks again for joining me and I hope you'll come back and visit us again soon thank you for having me do been a pleasure to be on the show and I'm always happy to share my thoughts and perspectives on AI in the future of technology thank
