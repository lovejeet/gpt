is alcohol good or bad for you in the answer is yes and yes drinking a modest amount of alcohol does have numerous health benefit if you overrule house not even that chicken cost of red wine would you believe in hi my name is in the health wealth and wisdom we do this by distilling signs and Collective wisdom into actionable information that anybody can act upon fighting right now I want to discuss how do you make sense of conflicting sides between you must have come across multiple are the three statements out there sometimes people say coffee is good for hell sometimes it's not good for health supplements like turmeric is bad for liver good for something else so vendors this world of conflicting information how can you trust and what can you make sense of the one really good cheat code is to consider this idea of this mental model resources the fact that your level of beef into any claim or should be commensurate to the level of evidence that backs of the big accounts and boots it's of course Italians to really go out and do a very good job of finding what amount of evidence is backing up for someone to see what kind of evidence is backing up that time to clean bottom of the pyramid is what you can call as animal studies or even in La Petite in these kind of experiments researchers do something on animals like mice big or sometimes they do things just don't put your dishes in the lab let's say you're testing a new drug and you'll give that job to some mice and then end up playing with exhibiting a certain kind of beneficial uses a picked up in a variety of outlets claiming that novel found a big breakthrough most of these animal models do not lie translate very well on to humans which means that most of these researches that are done on animals are done if they have a high failure rate when it comes to ultimately coming and benefiting humans this is why even though every second day we have a breakthrough research breakthrough finding in different areas different diseases would often be ultimate end in humans ends up being very very slow so the miracle Cancer drugs and really is just me. listen to very particular animal and also probably knew what a strange animal the next level of evidence do scientists think they're meeting but you have to understand that scientists are humans like you and me and they have very similar biases and which means they can end up sometimes consciously or unconsciously end up exaggerating certain things and they are reading too much into daytime so on this is simple example Lexi you get good sleep after you drink something I don't know you may end up giving that advice to all your friends you may say I have a very strong opinion because I drink turmeric milk at each night I get really good sleep. You might be getting good for you because you exercise in the morning and you get tired by the evening we might be getting sleepover you live in a very quiet neighborhood and the point of advice helped other and if it doesn't like to be on one person then of course it's not a useful advice whenever you come across a scientist or an expert opinion on something you have to always be curious whether it's an opinion or whether it's back by any evidence if it's not backed by evidence you need to be very skeptical about expert opinion is something which is all his observational study what's the recent study has happening and you try to guess what my be making that happen to very simple example Alexa You observe a group of people are there different people dream different model call and you end up tracking how long they live or how healthy they are and that day actually end up finding that people who drink water tomorrow while cause end up living longer and people who drink no alcohol or people who drink a lot of alcohol. This might be that it might be possible that a lot of media and just spinning Arby's finding but that's not true they could be so many just like the turmeric milk example they can affect common factors that could be driving boot the drinking of alcohol and no more. call and the beneficial effect in this particular case for example it is likely that people who drink moderate amount of alcohol people were able to stop at 1 bring their hymel cell discipline and self-discipline are also guided into different aspects of discipline into nutrition self-discipline to exercise it is possible that people who are able to stop at wondering or they have this better exercise to eat better but this does not mean that if you drink alcohol and you have high amount of self-discipline and say let's see you exercise when you have good diet it doesn't mean that if you start drinking I call it started back in your head positively because unit the system be working me you may have heard earlier correlation is not causation and in this case alcohol and little bit of a better health outcomes. Can you please about correlation and causation standard for teasing apart these two things is something that's called randomized controlled trial trial is very simple in concept let me demonstrate you with like an example you can do at home you have for the same feed to give them very similar amount of water every day they get some sunshine you change one factor one has fertilizer and other has no fertilizer and everything else in the same now when you how to measure its growth and other parameters maybe try to measure how green the leaves are around you can barely see if we attributed to the fact that you added fertilizer into one and no fertilizing to 2nd and this is just one factor proactively and this is how people beatboxing was tested this is how much when you have a population is split into two on multiple categories and you give different dosages or know the different groups and You observe what's impact on how long people live how how much they hospitalized in other outcomes are interested in the gold standard of evidence when it comes to what you should believe in the loop for animal control trials in nutrition in social sciences in any aspect you're interested in what is one caveat even with randomized controlled trials it is possible that the population you're studying in is biased but I'm in their biases that it is possible that if you get a group of 100 people and slip them into to say 50/50 that's fine but it is possible that the hundred people you got was just not representative of the entire population and this generally happens in fees that social science in Psychology where many of the psychology undergraduate and what works with psychology undergrads does not end up working for the larger population to go psychology and the Lord Byron mallott which others may not have a reputation crisis and it is real where in Lord of good results that psychologists have found a social scientist that found out is now not replicating when you do the same thing to my control trial with some population studies that examined dozens of publish pharmaceutical papers managed to replicate the results of less than 25% of them and similar results have been found and other scientific disciplines a simple example of a dare say you may have heard of this effect Greeneville power is like a muscle it is in whole pop psychology books but it was done in a randomized control trial and they found out that will power sort of weird of effuse more often but when it was replicated in other contexts more populations it did not leave out of applique and that's because it means that you really want to or not you are reading scientific research of teams to see very canning benefit you're not and if the scientific claim doesn't replicate then it's obviously not going to help you out so bad I even belong one level above it which is stronger. Stronger than randomized control trial and it's called the systematic analysis in Metairie use an ombre of randomized controlled trials so they would look at a hundred miles and funnel find out what is the common effect they all ended up getting to even do one study might be biased in certain it is likely if more studies are done they might be biased in Sumter and then you advertise them about the bise model has cancer and what it means is a common defect that you can generalize with a lot more confidence than you can generalize one single study McDonald's in systematic reviews is how we got a ton of confidence that secret and lung cancer are related but from a positive point of view and similarly all of her wisdom such as excess is helpful at least so long as it leads to less than all these are also a result of McDonald's in systematic reviews customer reviews are the highest levels of evidence that is most government bodies medical organizations like the community guidelines from McDonald's in systematic reviews big is a guidance from your 80 minutes in a week. Comes from Madonna this is where it was found out that this amount of exercise is most beneficial for health Solo or systematic review and meta-analysis when you are trying to find out whether claim is scientifically correct or not I know this is super confusing you know this you're not a scientist but you want to rely on science 35 I just leave you with one thumb rule I would have you remember that whenever you come across a scientific claim ask yourself in the cleaning or read the paper or article that it was done on a randomized control trial which humans are not whether you can find them do not believe in animal models even if there's an expert opinion and especially also if you find out Mission study we're all the study did was to observe two things in many cases do they just correlated and it was only if you are able to find a cause and effect can you apply that you your life and be guaranteed or at least have high confidence that affect will also follow otherwise you'll end up just wasting time if you apply something which is just all correlated for what I started off with where our mission is to distribute cheat code for life and help people take action on it I would leave you with the challenge and your challenge is to find three systematic review and meta-analysis and study them and destroyed them in our community, community discuss three different systematic analysis and mental abuse you can do this by going to partment of my desire for the three of us are the health related articles you can type in the questions of your interest may be interested in say effects of sleep and some supplements a item or they held an exercise and then on the left you'll have a filtering options by article types and simply select a systematic review as the article types and you'll only get these two types of Articles as result you can also go to Google Scholar if you're interested in non-biological related aspects are interested in some psychological experiments are interested in full-time and simply up and systematic review and meta-analysis you'll find lots of these big tree and start discussing them in the community I am I didn't hang out there so would love to help you there would love to discuss what you find out and I'm not in the spirit of Justice but in the spirit of helping to develop the habit of going and finding out that analysis Whenever there is a question of great importance to you and also to skip this isn't really find yourself how skeptical you have to be in terms of requiring a huge amount of evidence and you should not be leaving any scientific that you come across a healthy
