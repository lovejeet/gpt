have you ever noticed how everyone tells you you should be me see when stretching your cases but don't actually shows you how to do it Beyond a few simplistic examples back when I was a candidate I got so frustrated because all the kids into experts would lectured me and say you should build your own structures and learn how to do that or just make sure you not call people a senior structures but when they were actually teaching me then the story was different it was something like here's one example of a me some structure or just learned my to Frameworks and you'll be fine for 90% of the cases never mind the other 10% you're probably not going to get them anyway and when I went to interviews at Mackenzie at beIN what I found instead was that the majority of cases could not be solved using this pre-made framers from Kayden true books and then you needed to know how to create your own messes structures for that so I'm here to change that hey my name is Bruno, next McKinsey consultant and the co-founder of craft in cases where we teach you how to stand out in your case interviews by thinking like a top Management Consultant and then this video I'm going to show you the five ways to be me see if you learn these techniques well you going to learn how to create customized structures from scratch for your cases business problems and that will help you stand out in your case interviews and you never get stuck in the case again now in this video I'm going to give you an overview of the picture and then I'm going to make other videos and put a sequence of this one each detailing and give you the nuances of each technique so that you can actually put that in practice in your cases well came from a nine park article series and I wrote and that's on our websites Crafton cases.com Missy so if it gets you interested check it out so without further Ado let's jump right into the first way to be missing the first way to be me see Al jabri structures math equations math equations are a messy way to any numerical problem so he probably heard about the profitability framework it's equals Revenue Minus cost and that's just one type of algebra structure but many people don't realize is that whatever numerical metric you have to structure you can always break it down into a math equation and math equations are always messy because each variable must be independent from one another I mean they're different which means that there are no overlaps so they're mutually exclusive but also if you take all the metrics together they must equate the end result or the variable that you're breaking down it's an equation after all so there are no gaps which means they're collectively exhaust so let me show you examples of algebra structures and I'm going to do it for a case that is not too rare in case interviews I got a case like this in the in my Mackenzie final round but that you won't find in any case Evil Book probably because they don't have a framework for that and the case is what are possible reasons for a Nespresso market share dropped in the London coffee capsules or coffee pods Market I want a structured that's based on algebra or a math equation for this a lot of people would come up with Revenue has declined with we're not sure if that we just know that market share has dropped so here are for algebra structures that you could have come up with first you could have come up with this press is market share in capsules equals its share in machine so the percentage of machines of coffee machines that are Nespresso machines times the share of capsules of Nespresso within those machines so I broke down a certain percentage of machines turn espresso and then a certain percentage of capsules that are used within those machines are Nespresso capsules and that since presses market share another example could be the pretzels market share is the percentage of capsule customers that buy Nespresso eventually so that their customers they're not necessarily exclusive customers times the percentage of curse of capsules that these customers Buy. are Nespresso capsules in the equation for an espresso is market share in this market would be well how much percent of the points of sale of coffee capsules is Nespresso present in and I'm going to multiply that by the market share within those points of sale so we might have a problem of not being in enough points of sales or a problem of people not picking up our product and 1/4 ways to break down market share of course is Nespresso as revenues / the market size now this is probably the way most people would structured his problem and there's a problem in this last one I'm going to leave this problem to to see it in that in the next video in the series which is specifically on algebra structures but the thing is this formula is mathematically correct because this is the very definition of market share it doesn't really help us solve our problem now math equations and amazing way to structure a problem because Max is really precise when the structure problem via a math equation it becomes pretty clear to everyone how's the problem broken-down house the problem going to be solved but has a strong limitation to it which is you can only use it for math Florida medical problems also there are two factors that have to be very aware in your mind when using math equations I'm going to leave the details up those for the next video but you can just of it is the first thing when you have a strategic complex long-term problem even if it's a numerical problem it's often best knot to use math equations because they can get too simplistic and the second thing is when you use a math equation and you focus on the numbers alone on the variables alone you run the risk of not being inside phone up so you don't want to be a consultant what has all the equations in their minds but can never talk about real-world stuff so if you want to know how to use algebra structures correctly check out the video specifically on it it's an amazing way to structure a problem do it correctly and you should do it for the right types of problems we called this process structures this is probably the most underutilized structure type by candidates and you can say that might be one of the most useful so it's so simple it's so affected and I used to use them probably never did get my keys down the line logic is when you have a problem that has an underlying cross the street you can be me see by simply breaking down this problem into the stages of the process and this must be missing because processes have stage has to have a beginning a middle and an end that means that each stage is different from each other so it's mutually exclusive there no overlaps but also if you take all the stages together you have the whole problem you have the whole process that means that there are no gaps so it's collectively exhaustive example of a process structure I'm just going to use the same case Nespresso market share has been dropping into London's coffee capsules market and this is not the best case to use a process structure with its better to use it for manufacturing case is hiring cases sales that involves a process but if you can see an underlying process for market share and I can see one here which is the customer journey to buy our product that's kind of a process we can come up with a stretch even for this kind of problem so we can say that the first step of the process of the customer buying our product is that they have to have the required machine so maybe market share has been dropping because laskas you must have the required machine then the next step is that they have to find Nespresso capsules in their local stores whatever they show up for capsules if they shopping on the internet they're going to find it anyway but maybe less customers can find it so that's the second step because the customer has decided they want coffee to have the machine now then go to the store but they can't find this press the third step hear of the process would be that customers need to go to their store if they need to get interested to buy capsules so maybe last customers are interested to buy capsules capsules coffee capsules espresso skepsis the first step is that even if they're interested in these two need to pick up the capsule so maybe the capsules are locked up somewhere or they're not easily accessible or not attractive enough so they got interested at buying them but they they want by the or maybe it's too expensive and then finally the last step of the process is there buying capsules but they're buying last capsules than they used to be so I'm falling the customer journey to understand why this process market share has dropped and this is a process structure from our structures like that just check out the video on process structures are going to be problems that fit more with this but you can use Stickney for a variety of cases little bits to make Market Chef fit into a process wasn't the most elegant way to structure this case but it could be done and there are many types of problems where the most elegant way to stretch it and actually are processed stretches so as I said in the in the slides a Sears manufacturing hiring thinks with an underlying process I know this type of structure has a severe limitation which is if there are no processes underlying the problem then you can't use them at all also using for processes like problems in case it's a very strategic problem this may or may not be the best way to stretch them and the reason is when you change your strategy does the process stay the same does the process even exist so in strategic problems you may consider using conceptual structures which is the next part of this video is her problem does not come out of a process nor is it in America you probably need to use a conceptual framework which is the third way to be me see now are basically qualitative structures that come out of group in concert together some, maybe no one's are the three C's or Porter's five forces for the four Ps of marketing you can actually create your own conceptual Frameworks from scratch by grouping together ideas into brother concerts so let me give you an example here same case this press is market share grew up in the longest coffee capsules Market we can use to figure this out is well maybe this happens because our customers have changed our competitors have changed or our company has changed so one of these three players must have changed something and then we can do there's some that something deeper layers of our structure another example is assuming that there was no shortage of production of the capsules than either our product became less attractive or our distribution channels are harder to find or price is too high or new customers are unaware of our products so I'm just using traditional framer to hear the three seats on the left and the four Ps of marketing on the right in the four pieces actually have just the wording to be more specific to this problem specifically in the last bucket which tradition would be called promotion but I called it an awareness anyway I just use traditional Frameworks here but you can actually develop your own and be more specific to your cases because it can't quantify the parts of your structure it's hard to eliminate the parts that might not be important so if you're using an algebra structure or a process structure you can get some numbers and see which parts matter and which ones don't but when you use your conceptual framework you can't do it because put numbers into the parts of your structure and you can quantify customers or competition so this qualitative approach forces you to look into every area which is not very good for efficiency but that's pretty good if your overall goal is to get the whole context of the situation which is exactly the case when you have a complex long-term strategic problem so you are not used in most cases you use conceptual Frameworks in those types of cases even if they have an American problem for example of long-term corporate Revenue growth case could be useful to use a conceptual framework than a price and quantity Revenue type of structure so you still quantify whatever you can in this long-term complex strategic cases but you also wants to look things at the Quality sight more on this on the specific case for each technique specifically the one on conceptual Frameworks the bear this fact in mind a conceptual framework will force you to look at everything you can't eliminate with that which is bad if your goal is efficiency but it's good if you actually need to look at everything and you can't really get numbers to make the decisions are to make the whole decision I'll before moving on to the other two ways to be me see let's pause for a minute here we just went through what we called it three core stretching techniques algebra structures process stretchers and conceptual Frameworks eldest restructured eyes are much more insightful than the other two and so they should be the base of your street you whenever possible use them and you can actually structure any type of Problem by either using one of them or by combining each of these three into an issue tree so you might start a problem with an algebra structure and make an equation then get one variable of this equation and do the process structure to detail it another variable you might want to explore with a conceptual framework so that's something that's possible the other two types of structures I still useful mainly because they're so easy to do so you can make your structures back either with them or they can get you unstuck of certain situations so let's take a look at them the first way to be me see I called segmentations Temptations Arda favorite way that case intro experts are kissing to rule book writers use to explain the music concept and segments in basically means that you're slicing up the problem According to some Criterion for example I could say that Pizza is divided into the crust and the center and that's a way to segment the pizza or pizza segments in two slice number one slice number to slice number 3 now let's get into our case from this video just to see what segment he looks like in espressos marketshare exempt so you could say that Nespresso has lost market share either because they lost market share in the household Market or in the Carpet Mart or in the hotels and restaurants Market that they lost market share among low-income customers are middle-income customers or high-income customers or give us market share either because they lost market share in the e-commerce Channel or the old stories Channel or among retailers or they lost market share because they lost market share with customers who drink less coffee or more coffee soda segment on this presses market share loss and they're only see because you're considering the whole market and separating them in different ways or in Independence Parts segmentations can be useful but only as compliments of other types of stretches because they're tracking the same metric across segments in our case we're still tracking market share in the household Market in the carpet markets are in the hotels and restaurants Market we went from market share to market share in each market because of that they can lead you to a Direction but they can never tell you why your mic it sure is dropping this is because and this is the reason why they're not as insightful as other structure types can be because the segmentation Leisure to hypothesis but never to a root cause they can never get you to the roots of the problem so you can use them to spice up your structures but if you base your whole problem solving approach in segmentations you always have hypothesis with you never be able to understand why things are happening which is a bad traits for a consultant by the way however there is one situation in which if you don't use segmentations you never gets to the root of the problem and we call that situation the mix effect we estimate that about 30% of cases in Traverse have them and they have them because there's a lot of strategic business problems that have this problem sand because it's a bit long to explain here we're going to leave that to the video on segmentations but just be aware that you usually use segmentations to spice up your problem-solving approach find better hypothesis show better hypothesis but they are actually necessary when have a mix effect problem and you can never guess when you get those so you segmentations as compliments to make better a hypothesis to spice up your stretches to get to the mix affect problem when you have it but use it as a compliment for a core structure that's actually going to be looking into deeper reasons of why some things happen or else why you should do something and finally the fifth way to be Missy is to use opposite words dessert Staples that you can use whenever you want them and they're pretty easy to use sonar case for example we could say that Nespresso market share has dropped because of internal factors or external factors are we could also say that it's because of brakes and Supply so products are not rich in the market are because of the loss of demand or we could say that it's because of marketing related and known marketing-related reasons so you can use opposite words to divide the problem in 22 and make it easier to solve them and to explain your approach in your ideas and of course I could have started this video by showing that there are two ways to be me see you can use opposite words or you cannot use opposite words and if I did that I would have lost all the insightfulness all the new wants one mistake that I see a lot of candidates Dewey is 2 / rely on this type of structure so they always use internal external Financial no Financial factors supply and demand and by doing so they lose all their insightfulness and they seem they seem a little bit to go to the interior so opposite words have their place they're great for quickly having a structure to communicate how to get you unstuck of certain situations just be careful not to over rely on the side of the church so this is it for 25 ways to be me you can read more in our 9 part article series at Crafton cases.com Missy or if you can just keep watching and I'm going to put a series of videos in this playlist one for each technique so that we can see other examples of this technique in prey this in different types of cases so that it can see how to properly use these techniques so that you can get their full potential and so that you're aware of common pitfalls and just things you should be aware of when using each of these techniques at the end of the playlist I'm going to put up a video on how to combine this fight techniques so that you can create these two trees a lot of people have asked me how to create customized issue trees for their case interviews just like I McKinsey consultant would and that's rude I'm going to show you how but it basically is putting together this five techniques into a cohesive structure for your case if you like this video please hit like & subscribe so you can subscribe to this channel also if any of these techniques from this video has transformed our changed how you decays into this house is stretching your cases I'd love to know about that so please write in the comments I'm going to read and respond to each one of them because I love to know how candidates transform their approach after using these types of techniques so I hope you like this video and I'll see you in the next one which is an algebra structure so stay tuned and go to the next video cuz it's a really good one
