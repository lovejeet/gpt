following is a conversation with Brian Johnson founder of Colonel a company that has developed devices that can monitor and record brain activity and previously he was the founder of Braintree a mobile payment company that Acquired venmo and then was acquired by PayPal and eBay quick mention of our sponsors four sigmatic netsuite grammarly and expressvpn check them out in the description to support this podcast as a side note let me say that this was a fun a memorable experience wearing the colonel flow brain interface in the beginning of this conversation as you can see if you watch the video version of this episode and there's a u-bahn to Linux machine sitting next to me collecting the data for my brain the whole thing gave me hope that the mystery of the human mind will be unlocked in the coming decades as we begin to measure signals from the brain had been which way to understand the mind we either have to build it or to measure it both I want to try thanks to Brian and the rest of the colonel team for making this little demo happen this is the Lex fridman podcast and here is my conversation with Brian John you ready Luxe yes I'm ready just want to come in and put the interfaces on her head and then I will proceed to tell you a few jokes so we have two incredible piece of technology and a machine running a bunch of 2004 in front of what are we doing all right I did going on our heads are going on her head yeah and they will place it on our heads for proper alignment it doesn't support giant heads because I kind of a giant head like an eagle or are you staying physically or false a nice massage  it if it's okay to move around it feels all there so this is big head friendly it suits you well Lex thank you I feel like I need to I feel like when I wear this and you just don't like Sam Harris calm collected eloquent I feel smarter actually I don't think I've ever felt quite as much like I'm part of the future is now have you ever worn bringing her face or head to bring him missed never had my brain damaged the only way I've analyzed my brain is by talking to myself and thinking no direct data that is it that is definitely a brain or face has a lot of blind spots but yeah psychotherapy alright are we recording alright selects the objective of this I'm going to tell you some jokes and your objective is to not smile which has a Russian you could have an edge make the mother lime prod I got you okay let's hear the jokes Lex this is from the colonel crew we've been working on a device that can read your mind and we would love to see your thoughts is that the joke at the opening okay if if I'm blessed if I'm seeing the muscle activation correctly on your on your lips you're not going to do well in this let's see I hear here comes the person screwed here comes the first one is going to break the device there is a resilient to laughter Lex what goes through a potatoes brain I already failed that's so hilarious opener okay what Tater thoughts what kind of fish performs brain surgery I don't know a neurosurgeon   and so we're getting data of everything that's happening in my brain right now lifetime yeah we're getting activation patterns of your entire cortex I want to try to do better I'll let it out all the parts where I left photo shop in the series face over me you can recover all right to Scholars eat when they're hungry I don't know what I could tame you nuts has been going so what we'll do is so you're wearing turn off low which is an interface built using technology called spectroscopy so it's similar to what we wear wearables on the wrist using light using light are as you know and were using. Two images of the functional Imaging of brain activity and so as your neurons fire electrical Ian and chemically it creates blood oxygenation levels were measuring. And so when you'll see in the reconstructions we do for you you'll see your activation pattern to your brain as throughout this entire time we are wearing it so in the reaction to the jokes and as we were sitting here talking and so it's it's a we're moving towards a real-time feed of your cortical brain activity so there's a bunch of things that are in contact with my skull right now how many of them are there and so how many of them are what are they what are the actual sensors there's 52 modules and each module has one laser and six senators and their the sensors fire in about a hundred PS and then the photons scattering absorbing your brain is in a few go in if you come back out if you come back out on me since those photons in the week do the Reconstruction of activity overall there's about a thousand plus channels that are sampling your activity how difficult is it to make it as comfortable as it is cuz it's surprising comfortable I would not think it would be comfortable Sunday is measuring brain activity I would not think will be comfortable but it is I agree fact I want to take this home yeah yeah that's right so people are accustomed to being in big systems like a eyewear there's 120 decibels down that you're in a republican in casement oriji was just painful or surgery and so yes I agree that this is a convenient option to be able to just put on your head at measure brain activity in the contextual environment you choose so if we want to have a during the podcast if we want to be a home in a business setting it's freedom to be where to record to bring activity in the setting that you choose to have both served from an A near perspective are these what is it there's a bunch of different modular Parts in their kind of the zika rubber band thing where they have a Mulcher the shape of your head that's right the way we built this version the mechanical design to accommodate most adult heads and I have a giant head and if it's fine if it fits well actually so I don't think I have an average head maybe I can I feel much better about my head now maybe I am I more average than I thought okay so what else is there an interesting he could say was something while it's on our heads I can keep this on the whole time this is kind of awesome and it's amazing for me as a fan of a bunch of he's about to mate you guys use that too but it's amazing to have cold running to the side measuring stuff and collecting data I mean I just I feel like much more important let my data is being recorded like somebody you know when you have a good friend that listens to you that actually like listens like actually is listening to you that's what I feel like I'm making much better friend because it's like accurately listening to me the van to what a cool perspective I hadn't thought about that of feeling understood their party yet heard deeply by the mechanical system that is according your brain activity versus versus the human that you're engaging with that your mind immediately goes to that there's this dimensionality in depth of understanding of the software system with your intimate familiar with and now you're able to communicate with the system in ways that you couldn't before I feel heard I guess what's interesting about this is your intuitions are spot-on most people have intuition I'll bring your faces that they've grown up with this idea of people moving cursor is on the screen or typing or changing the channel is keeping a song it's primarily been anchored on control and that he'd be more relevant understanding of bring interfaces ignore Imaging is that it's a measurement system and once you have numbers for a given thing the seemingly endless number of possibilities emerged around that of what to do with those numbers so before you tell me about the possibilities was an incredible experience I can get the song for another 2 hours but I'm being told that for a bunch of reasons just because you probably want to keep the data small and visualize it nicely for the final product when I cut this off and take this to take this amazing helmet away from me so Brian thank you so much for this experience and let's let's continue without helmetless all right that was incredible experience can you maybe speak to what kind of opportunities that opens up that stream of data that restring of data from the brain first curious what is your reaction what what comes to mind when you put it on your head what does it mean to you and what possibilities emerge and what significance might have have um I'm curious where your orientation is at well for me I'm really excited by the possibility of there is information about my body about my mind being converted into Data such that data can be used to create products that make my life better so that that's me is really exciting possibility even just like a Fitbit that measures I don't know some very basic measurements about your body is really cool but it's the the band with them information the resolution of that information is very crude so it's not very interesting with the possibility of recording I'm just building a data set coming cleanway the high-bandwidth way from my brain opens up all kinds of the very I was kind of joking we're talkin but it's not really is like I feel hard in the sense that it feels like the full richness of the information coming from my mind is actually being recorded by the machine I mean there's a I can't I can't quite put it into is but there is a genuinely for me there's not some kind of joke about me being a robot is it genuinely feels like I'm being heard in a way that that's going to improve my life as long as the thing that's on the other end could do something useful with that data but even though the recording itself is like once you record it's like taking a picture that moment is forever saving time now picture can allow you to step back into that world but perhaps recording your brain is much higher resolution thing much more personal recording of that information that a picture that would allow you to step back into that where you were in that particular moment in history and then map out of certain trajectory to tell you certain things about about yourself I can open up all kinds of apples of course this house that I consider but I honestly to me the exciting things just being hurt my state of mind the level of focus all those kinds of things being hard what I heard you say is you have an entirety of lived experience some of what you can communicate in words and in body language some of what you feel internally which cannot be captured in those communication with Aldi's and that this measurement system captures both the things you can try to feeling words being a lower dimensional space using one word for example to communicate Focus dimensional space of this particular kind of focused and that this information is being captured do they close the representation to the entirety of your experience captured in Dynamic fashion that is not just a static image of your conscious experience that that's that's that's the promise that's the hope that was the feeling and it felt like the future so free quote friends in from the sort of mechanical perspective it was cool to have an actual device that feels pretty good that doesn't that doesn't require me to go into the lab and also the other thing I was I was feeling there's a guy named Bender hubermann is a friend of mine amazing podcast people should do should listen to a human Lab podcast we're all working at a paper together about I moving and so on and we're kind of he's on your side this time a data person machine learning we're we're both excited by how much the at how much the data measurements of the human mind the brain and all the different metrics that come from that can be used to understand human beings and the in a regular scientific west of the other thing I was thinking about is how this could be turned into a tool for science so if not just personal size not just like Fitbit Style like how am I doing on my personal metrics a health but doing water just skill studies of human behavior and so on so like data not at the scale of an individual but data is Gail of many individuals are a large number of individuals to sign those personal being heard was exciting and also just for science as exciting as very easy like it like that does a very powerful thing to add being so easy to just put on that you could scale much easier if you think about that second thing is what about the science of the brain most we've done a pretty good job weed human race has done a pretty good job figuring out how to quantify the things around us from distance Cara stars to calories and steps and our genome so we can measure and quantify pretty much everything in the known universe except for our minds and we can do these one off if we're going to get enough Mirai scan or do something with the low-res EG system but we haven't done this a population scale and so if you think about humans thought human cognition is probably the single law largest raw input material into society at any given moment is our conversations with are dark elves and with other people and we have this did Ron put that we can't that haven't been to measure yet and if you when I think about it to that frame it's remarkable it's almost like we live in this wild wild west Ivana Quantified Communications within ourselves in between each other when everything else has been grounded me for example I know if I buy an appliance at the at the store or Illinois on a website I don't need to the measurements on the appliance make sure I can fit to my door that's an engineered system of Appliance manufacturing and construction everyone's agreed upon engineering standards and we don't have engineering standards around cognition is not as it has not entered as a formal engineering discipline that enabled us to scaffold and Society with everything else we're doing including Kissimmee news our relationships politics economically education all the above until meet the two most significant contribution. Colonel technology has to offer would be the formal introduction to function in a cognition as a relates to everything else in society I love that I idea that you kind of think that there is just this ocean of data that's coming from people's brains as being in a crude way reduced down to Mike tweets and text and so on and so it's a very hardcore mini scale compression of the actual with the raw data but maybe you can comment because you use the word cognition I think the first step is to get the brain data but is there a leap to be taken to serve interpreting that data in terms of cognition says your is your idea is basically you need to start collecting data scale from brain and then we start to really be able to take Little Steps along the path to actually measuring some deep sense of cognition because it's you know as I'm sure you know we don't you understand a few things but so we don't understand most of what makes up cognition this has been one of the most significant challenges of building Colonel and Colonel wouldn't exist if I wasn't able to fund it initially by myself these when I engage in conversations with investors the I thought is what is a killer app and of course I understand that you're a sick that's what they're looking at is to look into D risk is the products all is there a customer base are people willing to pay for it how is it compared to competing options and in the case of printer faces when I started the company there was no known path to even build a technology that could potentially become mainstream and then once we figure out the technology we could even we could commence having conversations with investors and it became what is a killer app is the weather has been so I 500 first 53 million dollars for the company and to raise the round of funding that person we did I spoke to 228 investors one said yes it was remarkable and it was mostly around this concept around what is a killer app and so internally the way we think about it is we think of the the go-to-market strategy much more like the Drake equation where if we can bill technology that has the characteristics of that has the data quality sign up and meet some certain threshold cost accessibility Comfort can be worn in context environments if it meets the criteria of being a mass-market device then the responsibility that we have is to figure out how to create the algorithm that enables shoot the human the neighbor humans to Define value with it so it's the analogy is is like brand new faces are like early 90s of the internet if you want to populate an ecosystem with a certain number devices you want a certain number of people who play around with them and do experiments at 8:00 in primer if you want to encourage their mistakes from experts and Onyx Birds these are all critical elements that ignite Discovery and so we believe we've accomplished the first objective Building Technology that reaches Raffles and now it's the Drake equation component of how do we try to generate 20 years of value Discovery in a tour through your time. How to be compressed that so just to clarify what you mean the Drake equation which for people who don't know I don't know why you if you listen to this I bring up aliens every single, cuz you tell you that I don't know how you would know what the Drake equation is but do you mean like the killer app it would be one aliens Malaysian at equations the meaning like in this is in search of an application has in fact that's right by the way should be if we need to come up with a better term and killer app as a as a pilot right you can go like viral app that's horrible to write some very inspiring Lee impactful application how about that now yeah it was killer at this fine nobody's silent car with you I just like the chosen words in in capturing the concept you know it's one of those sticky things that is effective to use in the tech world when you have now become a communicator outside of the Dark World especially when you're talking about software and hardware and artificial intelligence applications it sounds corny I actually regret now having called attention to I regret having use that word in this conversation because something I would not normally do I I used it in order to create a bridge of shared understand of how others would what coming all the others would use but yeah I concur let's go with impactful application or go to Value creation value creation and something people love using that we go love app okay so what do you have any ideas you basically creating a framework but there's the possibility of a discovery of an application people love using is dfid has weave can you play a fun game internally where when we have these discussions a week we began circling around this concept of does anybody have an idea does anyone have intuitions and if we see the conversation starting to to Vere not direction we flag it and say human intuition alert stop it is if we really want to focus on the album of Thursday natural process of human discovery that that when you populate a system with Isis and you give people the opportunity to play around with it and expected and unexpected ways we are thinking that is a much better system of Discovery than us exercising tuitions intentions were also seen a funeral scientists who have been talking to us while I was thinking just one young associate professor and I approach the conversation and said hey we have these five data streams that were pulling off when you hear that what weighted value do you add each data source like which one I think is going to be viable for your objective than and which ones not and he said I don't care just give me the data all I care about is my machine learning model but importantly he did not have a theory of mind he did not come to the table and say I think the brain operates you have within this way and these reasons are these please function he didn't care he just want the data and we're seeing that more and more. Certain people are devaluing human intuitions for good reasons that we seen a machine learning over or the past couple and we're doing the same in in our valuation Market strategy so more collect more data clean data make all the products at the collection of data is easy and and and fun and then the rest was just spring to life that's why through humans playing around with the projective is to create the most valuable data collection system rain ever and with that then applying all the best tools of machine learning another techniques to extract out if I try to find inside but yes our our objective is really to systematize Discovery process because we we can't put definite time frames on Discovery the brain is complicated in and science is not a business strategy and so we really need to figure out how to is it a cold you bringing bringing your technology gets to Mark and it's why most of time it just linked it languages and I could do Macadamia for quite some time but we hope that we will cross over and make this mainstream in the coming years the thing was cool to wear but what's are you chasing a good reason for millions of people to put it this on their head and keep on their head regularly is there a a cruise go to discover that reason is it going to be people just kind of organically or is there going to be a Angry Birds style application is just too exciting to do not use if I think through the things that have changed my life most significantly over the past few years when I started wearing a wearable in my wrist that would give me data about my heart rate heart rate variability operation rate metabolic approximation excetera for the first time in my life I had access to information sleep patterns that were highly impactful that they they told me for example if I eat close to bedtime I'm not going to get deep sleep and not getting deep sleep means you have all these following consequences in life and do it opened up this window of understanding of myself that I not self introspect and deduce these things this information that was available to be acquired but it just wasn't I would have to dig inexpensive sleep study then it's an end one night and that's not good enough to look through all my trials and so if you like just at the information that one can acquire on their wrist and now your planet's entire cortex on the brain and you say what kind of information could we acquire it opens up a whole new universe of possibilities. For example we did this internal study at call where I wore protective ice and we were measuring the cognitive effects of sleep so I had a device measure my sleep I performed with 13 a Mexican my co-workers the form for cognitive tasks over a 13 seconds and we focused on Reaction Time impulse control short-term memory and they're resting state task and we might be found from samples. My impulse control was independently correlated with my sleep outside of Behavioral measures are my ability to play the game the point of the study was I had the brain sorry I did a colonel confirmed my life experience. If I my deep sleep determined whether or not I will be able to resist temptation the following day and my brain is a shield that as one example and so if you start thinking if you actually have a date on yourself on your on your tire cortex you can't control. settings I think there's probably an in a large number of things that we can discover about ourselves very very small and very very big I just read a like when you read news what's going on my phone use social media when you use news what the would like guy all the ways we allocate attention that's rightly with a computer that seems like a compelling place to where you would want to put on Colonel weather what is it called Colonel flux what flow you are flow flow okay so when you when you put on the current flow it is seems like to be a compelling time and place to do is when you behind a desk behind a computer you can probably work for prolonged periods of time as long as you taking in content and a lot of get some of our so much of our Lives happens in the digital world now that kind of coupling the information about the human mind with the consumption and the behaviors in the digital world might give us a lot of information about the effect of the way we behave and navigate the digital world to the actual physical meet space effects on our body it's interesting to think of certain terms of both like for work I am a big girl fan of the Cal Newport his ideas of deep work I spend with you exceptional I try to spend the first two hours of every day usually if I'm like at home and have nothing on my schedule is going to be the up to 8 hours of deep work a focus 0 to straction and for me to analyze the let me know I'm very aware of the the waning of that the ups and downs of that and it's almost like you you're surfing the ups and downs of that as you're doing programming as you do thinking about Jacob problems trying to visualize things in your mind you trying to stitch them together you trying to when there's a dead end about an idea if the kind of calmly like walk back start again all those kinds of prophecies would be interesting to get data on the Run has actually doing and also recently started doing I just thought Sam Harris a few days ago and I've been building up to that I started using started meditating using his app I'll waking up at very much recommend it and you should get date on that cuz it's your very it's like you're moving all the noise from your head you very much is an active process of active noise removal active noise cancelling headphones and it'd be interesting to see what is going on the Mind before the meditation during it and after all those has a thing examples it's interesting that everyone who has designed an experience for you so Weatherby the meditation app or the Deep work or with all the things you mentioned that they constructed the product with a certain number of nones out what if we expanded the number of melons by 10x or 20x a 30 x they would reconstruct their product called corporate those now and so be and so this is the dimension ality that I think is the promising that is people will be able to use the quantification use this information to build more effective products and visit I'm not talking about better products to advertise to you or manipulate you on talking about our focus is helping people individuals have this context awareness and qualification and then to engage with others who are seeking to improve people's lives that the objective is is betterment across. I felt individually and also with each other to have if you're building an app like if you're building a podcast listening app will be nice to know data about the listener so that like if you're bored or you fell asleep maybe pause the podcast dumb just very simple applications that could just improve the quality of the experience of the using the app and imagine if you have you have your neural is Lex and you Thursday at the store presentation of you you engage with the app it says Lex your best to engage with this meditation exercise in the following settings at this time of day after eating this kind of food or not eating fasting with this level of blood glucose and just kind of night sleep but all these data combined to give you this contextually relevant experience just like we do with our sleep well you've optimized your entire life DePaul one information you can acquire and know about yourself the question is how much do we really know of the things going around us and I would venture to guess in my own it my life life experience I capture my self-awareness captures an extremely small percent of the things that actually influence my conscious and unconscious during the day that would help encourage you to be more self-aware not just because you trust everything to do this thing is it will give you a prod to start investigating I got to look at it like a rating like a ranking of all the things I do and what are the things that probably important to do without the data but the data will certainly help is like ranked all the things you do in life and which ones make you feel shity which must make you feel good like you talked about evening Brian I got this is a good example somebody like I do pig out at night is as well and and it's never me like you're just a space it is a supposed to say say it says never know I definitely have much less self-control at night it and it's interesting in the same you know people my criticizes but I know my own body I know when I eat carnivore just eat me I feel much better than if I eat more more car the more cops they eat the worst I feel I don't know why that is I don't get there is side supporting but I'm not leading outside something a person and that's really important I don't need to read I'm not going to going to read about nutrition science but many of those studies and very flawed they're doing their best nutrition science is a very difficult field of study because humans are so different and the mind has so much impact on the way your body behaves and it's so difficult for massage New Perspective to conduct really strong studies do you have to be almost like a scientist of any of one if you do these studies on yourself that's the best way to understand what works you're not and I don't understand why cuz it sounds unhealthy but eating only meat always makes me feel good just to eat meat that's it and I don't have any allergies any of that kind of stuff I'm not full of Jordan Peterson we're like if you like deviates a little bit that he goes off it's a little bit from the carnivore diet he goes off a lick the cliff know I can I can have a chalk I can I can go off the diet I feel fine it's not it's a it's a gradual it's a gradual worsening of how I feel but what I eat only meat I feel great and it'd be nice to be reminded of that like it's a very simple fact that I feel good when I eat carnivore and I think that repeats itself and all kinds of experiences like I feel really good when I exercise not I hate her size but in the rest of the day they ain't the the impact it has on my mind and the clarity of mind and the experience than the happiness of all those kinds of things I feel really good and to be able to concrete the express that today Toby would be nice and be nice reminder almost I could stay but like remember what feels good and what not and there could be things like that I'm not many things I just you're suggesting that I could not be aware of their might be sitting right in front of me that makes me feel really good and make me feel not good and the date of the show that I agree with you I actually employed the same strategy I I fired my mind entirely from being responsible for constructing my diet if I started doing a program why not track over 200 mile markers every 90 days and it capture of course the things you'd expect that cholesterol but also DNA methylation and all kinds of things about my body all the prophecies and makeup me and that I left that data generate the shopping list as I never actually asked my mind what it wants it's entirely what my body is reporting that upon since I call this goal alignment within Brian and there's 200 plus actors that I'm currently asking their pink enough and some I'm asking my liver how are you doing and expressing via Dubai markers is it a construct that diet I only eat those Foods until my next testing ground and that has changed my life more than I think anything else because in the demotion of my conscious mind that I gave Prime to my entire life it led me astray because like you're saying the mind then goes out into the world are navigates the dozens of different dietary regimen people put together and books and it's all has the  I'll have the reporting science in certain context of settings but it's not end of one and like you're saying this guy dietary really is the end of one these people have published scientific League Of course can be used I for next groundings but it changes when you stand up on level and so that's what gets me excited about Brandon faces is if you if I could do the same thing for my brain where I can stop asking my conscious mind for his advice or for his decision-making which is flawed and I'd rather just look at this data that will end it. I never had their health markers in my life than the one I stopped actually asking myself to be in charge of it and the idea of demotion of the conscious mind is as such as head of engineering way of phrasing like meditation with what they were doing right now that's beautiful that means really beautifully put a bite of a testing ground what does that look like what's that you mentioned yet at the very the test I do yes so includes the complete blood panel I do a microbiome test I do a food inflammation of diet-induced information so I look for Exile kind Expressions the foods that produce inflammatory reactions I look at my neuroendocrine system to look at all my neurotransmitters I do if there's a test to see how it look into very very through trends self-report of like how you feel you know almost like you can't demote York on Tuesday to exist within your conscious mind so that that lived experience of is of a lot of value so you measure that your temple stamp lean over some duration of times all think through how I feel over a week or a month over 3 months I don't do at a sampling of if I'm at the grocery store in front of the cereal box you know what Captain Crunch is probably the right thing for me today cuz I'm feeling like I need a little fun in my life it's at the temple trampoline if the data sets large enough that I I smooth out the function of my natural oscillation how I feel about life where some days I may feel upset or depressed or down or whatever and I don't want those moments to then rule my decision-making that's why the demotion happens and it says really if you're looking at health or 9 today. Of time all my two hundred voices speak up on the interval and they're all like giving voice to say to say how I'm doing and this is what I want and so it really is an accounting system for everybody so that's why I think that if you think about the future of Being Human there's two things I think that are really going on one is the design manufacturing and distribution of intelligence is heading towards zero, cost curve over over a certain design over certain time frame our ability to your Evolution produces an intelligent life form of intelligence we are now designing our own intelligence systems and the design manufacturing distribution of that intelligence over a certain time frame is going to go to a cough 20 design manufactured distribution of intelligent cost is going to zero and just give me a second to get his brilliant and evolution is doing the design manufacturing distribution of intelligence now we're doing the design manufacture and distribution of intelligence and the cost of that is going to zero that's a very nice way of looking at life on Earth self that that's going and then now I'm parallel to that then you say okay what what then happens if will not cost curve is heading 20 our existence becomes a goal alignment problem alignment function and so the same thing I'm doing where I'm doing go alignment Within Myself of these two hundred mile markers where I'm staying when when Brian exist on a daily basis and this entity is deciding what to eat what to do when excetera it's not just my conscious mind which is a pining it's 200 Mi of prophecies and if so in that equation we're going to increase me automate the things that we spent high-energy on today cuz easier and now we're going to then negotiate the terms and conditions of intelligent life that we stay conscious existence because we're biased he doesn't we have but it will be the largest computational exercise in history because you're now doing go alignment with planet Earth within yourself with each other within all the intelligent agent for Building Boston other voice assistants you basically trillions and trillions of Agents working on the negotiation of gold limit this this is in fact true and what was the second thing that was at Subway cost to design manufacturing distribution of intelligence 120 which then means what's really going on what are we really doing we're negotiating the terms and conditions do you worry about the survival of this process that Life as We Know It On Earth comes to an end or at least intelligent life that is the Costcos 20 something happens where all of that intelligence is thrown in the trash by something like nuclear war or development of a GI systems are very dumb not a g I guess but AI sisters the paper clip thing would unmask is dumb but has unintended consequences to wear destroy human Revelation you worry about those kinds of things to me it's it's unsurprising that a new thing comes into the sphere of human consciousness humans identify the foreign objects in this case artificial intelligence are Nicola fires up and says scary foreign we should be apprehensive about this makes sense from a biological perspective the humans first lady knee-jerk reaction fear what I don't think has been properly waited with that is that we are the first generation of intelligent beings on this Earth that has been able to look out over there expected lifetime and see there is a real possibility of evolving into entirely novel forms of consciousness yeah so different that it would be totally unrecognizable to us today we don't have words for it we can't hint at it we can't point out we can't you can't look in the sky and see that thing that is shining we're going to go up there you cannot even create an aspirational statement about it and instead we've had this teacher reaction to fear about everything that could go wrong in my estimation this should be the defining aspiration of all intelligent life on Earth that we would aspire to basically every generation surveys the landscape of possibilities are afforded given the technological cultural and other contextual situation that they're in this context we haven't yet identified this instead this is unbelievable we should carefully think this thing through not just a mitigating the things our life is out like we have this potential and we just haven't given voice to it even though it's within this brown possibilities so you're excited about the possibility of super intelligence systems and what the opportunities that bring I mean this parallels to this you think about people before the internet as the internet was coming to life and it's kind of a fog through what you can't see what is the future look like you get your bread predicting collective intelligence which I don't think we're understand that we're living through that now was the Thursday with live in some sense stop being individual intelligences and become much more like collective intelligence has because ideas travel much much faster now and they can in a viral way like sweep across the population so it's almost I mean it almost feels like I thought this had by many people now thousands or millions of people as opposed to an individual person change everything but to me I don't think we're realizing how much that actually changed my people or societies but like to predict that before the internet would have been very difficult and that's when we were sitting here with the fog before us thinking what is super intelligent systems how is that going to change the world what is increasing the bandwidth like plugging our brains into this whole thing how's that how to change the world and it seems like it's a fog you don't know and that it could be it could do whatever comes to be could destroy the world that this would be the last generation but also could transform and in ways that crazy and Incredibly fulfilling life experience that's unlike anything we've ever experienced it might involve dissolution of ego and it depends how long you no longer one individual it might be more you know that might be a certain kind of death and ego death but the experience might be really exciting and enriching maybe we'll live in a virtual like it's like it's it's it's fine you think about a bunch of hypothetical questions of would it be more fulfilling to live in a virtual world like if you were able to plug your brain in in a play Dance way until video game I wish world would you want to live in in the video game when the physical world the most of us what kind of Towing it with a G of the video game but we still want to live in the physical world have friendships and relationships in the physical world but we don't know that again it's a fog and maybe maybe in a hundred years were all living inside a video game hopefully not Call of Duty hopefully more like Alex Sims 5 which which version is it on for you individually though does it make you sad that your brain ends that's you die one day very soon at the whole thing that that that that data source just goes offline sooner than you would like that's a complicated question and I would have answered it differently in different my life I knew I had chronic depression for 10 years and so in that 10 your time. I desperately wanted lights to be off and the thing that made it even worse is I was in a religious I was born into a religion it was the only reality I ever understood it's difficult to articulate to people when you're born into that kind of reality that the only way out here exposed to you are literally blinded to the existence of other realities because it's so much that and so in that situation it was not only that I definitely want to buy that out wherever it was that I couldn't have like that from it was but it was an afterlife and this afterlife had this system that would either penalize or or reward you for your behavior and so is almost like this is Indescribable hopelessness of not only being despair of not wanting to exist but then also being forced to be able to exist and so there was a duration of my time of the alteration of Life ride say yes I have no remorse for like being out and actually wanted more than anything in the entire world they're all the times where I'm looking out at the future and I say this is an opportunity for future evolving human conscious experience that is beyond might go to understand it and I jump out of bed and I raced to work and I can't think about anything else but I I think the the reality for me is I don't know what it's like to be in your head but in my head when I wake up in the morning I don't say good morning Brian I'm so happy to see you like I'm sure you're just going to be beautiful to me today you're not going to make a huge long list of everything you should be anxious about your knocking repeat Kissimmee for winter time you're not going to have me we relive all the requests I've made in life I'm sure you're not doing any of that you just going to just help me along all day long and it's a brutal environment in my brain and we've just become normalized to this environment we just accept that this is what it means to be human but if we look at it if we try to muster as much silver as we can about the realities of Being Human it's brutal if it is for me and so am I sad that the brain may be off Monday depends on the context of studying I call myself what moment are you asking me that and that's it's my mind is so fickle and this is why I again I don't trust my conscious mind I have been given reality I guess I was given a religious reality that was a video game and then I figured out it was not a real reality and then they lived in a depressive reality which delivered this terrible hopelessness real reality that I discovered a behavioral psychology and I figured out how biased 188 Chronicle by a season-high my brain is distorting Valley of the time I have gone from one reality to another I don't trust reality I don't trust realities are given to me and so to make try to make a decision on what I value or not value that future State I don't trust my response so not fully not fully listening to the conscious mind has any one moment has ultimate truth but allowing you to go up and down as it does kind of being observing it yet I assume that whatever my conscious mind delivers up to my weariness is wrong on Pond landing and I just need to figure out where it's wrong how was wrong how wrong it is and then try to correct for it as best I can but I I assume that on impact if it's mistaken in some critical ways is there something you could say by way of advice undermine is depressive when the conscious mind serves up something that you know so the dark thoughts how you deal with that my calling your own life you overcome that and others were experiencing that I can overcome it two things one that those depressive states are biochemical States it's not you and the sea Justin's that these things that the state delivers to you about suggestion of the hopelessness of lies to order or the meaninglessness of it or that you should pick the eject button that's a false reality and that it's when I completely understand the rational decision to commit suicide there's it is not lost on me at all but that is that is that is an international situation but the key is when you're in a situation Walter Landing to be able to say thank you you're not real I know you're not have enough yeah and so I'm in a situation with for whatever reason I'm having this this no chemical state but. State can be altered so it begin it goes back to the realities of the difficulties of Being Human and like what I was trying to solve my depression I tried literally have you name it I tried it systematically and nothing would fix it and so this will give me help with brand new faces for example like could I have numbers on my brain can I see what's going on cuz I got to go to the doctor and see how do you feel I don't know terrible I got to help my dad about you want to commit suicide 10 at this moment has bottle how much I take why don't know like just a very very crude and his data opens up the the cat is it opens out the possibility of really helping in those dark moments that to First understand the other ways Dobson down. I was I'm not complete flip side of that right I am a very conscious in my own brain and deeply deeply grateful that what there is it's almost like a chemistry thing about chemistry thing that I go many times throughout the day I'll I'll look at like this cup and be overcome with joy how amazing is to be alive like I actually think I'm my biochemistry such that it's not as common I got to talk to people and I don't think that's that comment like it's a and it's not a rational thing at all it's like I feel like I'm on drugs and I'll just be like and a lot of people talk about like the meditative experience will allow you to cervix look at some basic things that the movement of your hand as deeply joyful because it's like that's life I get that from just looking at a cup I am waiting for the coffee to brew and I'll just be like fuck life is awesome and I'll sometimes to eat that but then I like regret it later like God damn it you so ridiculous but yeah so but that is purely chemistry I got it I did there's no rational it doesn't fit with the rest of my life I have all this shit I'm always late stop I'm always like there's all that stuff in the AMA Supercross self-critical like really talk reading about everything I do I'm almost to the point of almost hate everything I do but there's this engine of joy for life outside of all that and that has to be chemistry in the flip side of that is what depression probably is is the opposite of that feeling of like cuz I I bet you that feeling of the copying amazing it would save anybody in the state depression exactly that would be like fresh with you and you're in a desert and it's a it's a drink of water ship and the brain is it would be nice to understand where that's coming from to be able to understanding how you hit those laws in those eyes that have nothing to do with the actual reality it has to do with some very specific aspects of how you maybe see the world maybe it could be just like basic what's the engagement and then Saturday I walk along the lines at me to find those experiences of joy and it goes back to the discussion we're having of human cognition is in volume the largest input of Rob material into society and it's not Quantified we have no bearings on it and so we just you wonder we both articulated some of the challenges we have in our own mind and it's black play the others would say I have something similar and you wonder when you look at Society what how does that contribute to all the other compounder problems that were experiencing how does that blind us to the the opportunities we could be looking at and so it really it has this potential Distortion effect on the reality that just makes everything worse and I hope if we can put some if we can assign some numbers to these things just to get our bearings so we're aware of what's going on if we could find Bitter stabilization and how we conduct our lives and how we built Society  it might be the thing that enabled us to scaffold cuz we've really again we sent a human has done a fantastic job systematically scaffolding technology and science institutions it's human these are all our own selves which we have not been able scaffold it's if we are the we are the one part of this intelligence infrastructure that remains unchanged is there something you could say about coupling this brain-dead out with not just the basic human experience but say an experience you mentioned sleep but the wildest experience which is psychedelics is there another been quite a few studies now they're being approved and Ron is exciting for from a scientific perspective on psychedelics do you think what do you think happens to the brain on psychedelics and how can dat about this help us understand it and when you're on DMT dcl's and can we guess him and convert that into the data at aliens in there yeah aliens definitely do you actually meet Aliens and elves are elves I'm asking for a referral few Austin friends yet that they're convinced that they've actually met the house later I was like are they friendly are they haven't met him the Smurfs like they're like they're industrious and they have different skill sets and yeah I think they're very they're very critical as friends is a troll troll uses the trolls there's a bunch of different version of trolls that there's a loving trolls that are harsh on you but they want you to do better in their Scrolls I just enjoy the your destruction and I think they're the ones that care for you like I think their criticism from a I haven't met them directed some like a friend of a friend a bit of an end and the whole point is done psychedelics and certainly have DMT the word that the brain data versus Ward data fails which is an award can't commit experience tells people that you can be poetic and so on but really does not convey these are the what what it actually means to me. To me tells me what bass lines this conversation is imagine if you if we were interested in the health of your heart and we started instead of Kayla ex-celtic effect tell me how's the health of your hair you sit there and you close your eyes you think Feels Alright like things doing things feel okay and then you would to the cardiologists and they called Alex a KLX tell me how you feel exactly what I'd really like you to do is do an EKG and a blood panel and look arterial plaques and listen to my cholesterol and it is like 5 to 10 study to do there then give you the support and say Here's the Quantified health of your heart now what does data do you prescribe the following regime of exercise and maybe I'll put you on the stand like a second visitor call is based upon this day that you would think the cardiologists is out of their mind if they just gave you a bottle of statins based upon your like well I think something kind of wrong and they're just kind of experiment see what happens that's what we do with our mental health today so it's kind of a third interview look at psychedelics to have begin to be able to measure the brain and get a base find state and then to measure during a psychedelic experience and post a psychedelic experience and do it longitudinally you now have a qualification of what's going on and so you could then posed questions what molecule is appropriate at what dosage is at what frequency in what context of environment what happens when I have this diet with a small issue with this experience all the experimentation you do when you have to sleep Gator or a tardy that's what I think happens what we could potentially do with Galaxy if we could add this level of sophistication that is not an industry currently and it may improve the outcomes people experience and may improve the safety and efficacy and that's why I hope we are able to achieve and it would transform mental health because we would finally have number through work with the base on ourselves and then if you think about it we when we talk about things related to the mind we talked about the modality we use words like meditation or delek sword or something else because we can't talk about a marker in the brain we can't use a word to say I we didn't talk about cholesterol we don't talk about plaque in the arteries we don't talk about HRV and so we have numbers than the solutions get mapped to numbers instead of the modalities be nothing to talk about meditation just does good things in a crude fashion so in your block Posey Rose principle thinking could title you Potter how do people come up with the truly original ideas what what's your thoughts on this as a human and as a person was measuring brain data 0 of principles are building blocks first principles our understanding of system laws so if you take for example I can Sherlock Holmes he's a first principle thinkery so he says once you've eliminated the impossible anything that remains however improbable is true whereas Dirk gently the holistic detective by Douglas Adams says I don't like eliminated the impossible so when someone says from a first principles perspective and they're trying to assume the fewest number of things within a given time frame and so when I after I bring through venmo I set my mind to the question of what Singleton can I do that would Max will increase the probability that the human race thrives beyond what we can even imagine and I found that in my conversation with others and in the books I read a my own deliberations I had a missing piece of the puzzle because I didn't feel like I didn't feel like the future could be deduced from first principle thinking and that's when I I read the book a biography of a dangerous idea and I really could book by its I think it's my favorite book I've ever read it's also really interesting number 0 and I wasn't aware that the number zero had to be discovered I didn't realize that it caused a revolution in philosophy and the end just tore up math and it tore up I mean build modern society but dude that wrecked everything in this way it was an unbelievable to dropped her and it was so difficult for society to get their head found it it's a 10in because of for the representation of a 0 principle thinking which is it's the caliber and consequential nature of an idea and so we talked about what kind of ideas have civilization transforming properties oftentimes it fall in the zeroth category and so I'm thinking it's the right I was wanting to find a quantitative structure on how to think about the zero principles nuts so I came up with that to be a a coupler with purple thinking it's been out the Staples out of how I think about the world in the future so precise is trying to identify the lands on that the word impossible is like what is impossible since you trying to identify what is impossible what is possible and being as how do you I mean this is the thing is most of society tells you the range of things they say is impossible is very wide and so you need to be shrinking that I mean that's the whole process of this kind of thinking is we need to be very rigorous and in trying to be trying to draw the lines of what is actually impossible because very few things are actually impossible I don't know what is actually impossible Joe Rogan it's entirely possible I like that approach to the science and engineering to entrepreneurship it's entirely possible basically shrink The Impossible 202 very small set of constraints favor first principles thinking because it it'll it enables faster action with higher probability of success for suing zoo with principal optionality is expensive and uncertain and so in a society constrained by resources time and money and a desire for social status a conference cetera it minimizes zero Crystal thinking about it but the reason why I think the zero pencil thinking should be a staple of our shared cognitive structure is if you look at the history of past couple thousand years and let's just say we arbitrarily we suggested we try to assess what is a zero level 10 level idea and we say how many have occurred on what time scales and what were the context of settings for it I would argue that if you look at alphago when it it played Go From Another Dimension with the human go players when they saw Alpha goes moves and attributed to explain with an alien playing go with us without being from another dimension and so if you say computational intelligence has an attribute of introducing zero like insights then if you say what is going to be the occurrence of zeros in society going forward and you could really say probably a lot more than have occurred and probably more at a faster Pace but if you say what happens if you have the computational intelligence throughout society that Factory designed to be some intelligence is now going through heading towards zero you have an increased number of zeros being produced with a tight connection between humans computers that's when I got the point and said we cannot predict the future with first principle thinking we can't that cannot be imagination set it can't be our sole anchor in the situation that basically the future of our conscious existence 20 30 40 50 years is probably Adderall just to clarify when you say zero you're referring to basically truly revolutionary idea yet something that is currently not a building block of our shared conscious existence either in the form of knowledge manifest in what we acknowledge is 0 principle thinking is playing with ideas that are so revolutionary that we can't even clear the reason about the consequences once those ideas come to be at work for example if I'm Stein that was a zero with that I would categorize at the zeroth principal inside that you mean General at City Base time you like building a pond what Newton had done and said yes also and I just changed the fabric of our understanding of reality and do that was unexpected it existed we just became part of our awareness and the moves alphago made existed it just came into our awareness and so it to your point there's this question of what do we know and what don't we know and do we think we know ninety nine percent all things or do we think we know .00 1% of all things and that goes back to no no no no no no no no one's and first principles and 0.4 thinking gives us a quantitative framework to say there's no way for us to mathematically try to create probabilities things therefore it would be helpful if they were to part of our standard thought processes because it may encourage different behaviors in what we do individual collectively its Society will be inspired to what we talked about the possibility since we imagined yeah I've been engaged in that kind of thinking quite a bit and thinking about the engineering of Consciousness I think it's feasible I think it's possible in the language that we use and care and it's very difficult to reason about a world when inklings of Consciousness can be engineered into artificial systems not from a philosophical perspective but from an engineering perspective I believe a good step towards engineering Consciousness is is creating engineering the illusion of Consciousness I'm captivated by our natural predisposition to anthropomorphize things and I think that's what we I don't want to hear from philosophers but I think that's what we kind of do to each other like that Consciousness is created socially that like much of the Power Of Consciousness is in the social interaction I create your Consciousness know I create my Consciousness by having interacted with you and that that's the display of Consciousness it's the same as like the display of emotion motion is created through communication language is created through its use and then we somehow humans kind of brush your philosophers you know the hard problem of Consciousness really want to believe that we possess this thing that's like there's a there's a there's a there's an elf sitting there with a half-ass it or like name tags as Consciousness and they're like eating the sixth subjective experience to us as opposed to like it actually being an illusion of a construct to make social communication more effective and so I think if you focus on creating the illusion of Consciousness you can create some very fulfilling experience in software so that to me is the compelling space of ideas to explore I agree with you and I think going back to our experience together with printer faces on you could imagine if we get to a certain level of maturity the first we'll take the inverse of this so you and I-10 back and forth and worse than each other emojis that has a certain amount of information transfer rate as we've communicated to each other and so in our communication with people at the via email and text will not we've taken the band with the human interaction if I should transfer rate and we produced it we have less social cues we have less information to work with there's a lot more options misunderstanding so that is altering the conscious experience between two individuals and if bring your face is equation that's imagine now we amplify the dimensionality of our Communications that to me is what you're talkin about which is conscious of engineering perhaps I understand you with Dimensions so maybe I understand your hat when you look at the cup and you experience that happen if you can tell me you're happy and I then do theory of mine and say I can imagine what it might be like to be like some feel happy about seeing his cop but if you do face giving quantify and give me a 50/50 Vector space model and say this is the version of Happiness Alexis experiencing is able to stop then it would allow me potentially to have much greater empathy for you understand you as a human of this is how you experience Joy yes which is entirely unique from how I experienced Joy even though we assumed they had the time that we have ever having some kind of similar experience but I agree with you with the we do Consciousness engineering today and everything we do when we talk to each other when we're building products and that we're entering into a a stage way it will be much more methodical and quantitative Basin computational and how we go about doing this to me I find encouraging because I think it creates that our guard rails for to create a physical systems on Everest right now I feel like it's really wild wild west on how these infractions are happening in front of you folks and humid humid but that this kind of data tables human to machine yesterday. which is what we were kind of talking about when we say engineer in consciousness and that will happen of course has flipped out on his head let's right now we're putting humans as the central node what if we gave gpt-3 a bunch of human brains that hey gp3 learn some manners when you speak and write your algorithms on humans brains and see how they respond so you can be polite sou can be friendly and so that you can be conversational appropriate but to inverse it to give our machines a training set in real time with closed-loop feedback so that our machines were better equipped to I'll find a way through our society in polite and kind an appropriate ways I love that idea or better yet each had some I haven't read the following documents have a visit Austin and Texas and so that when you asked when you tell it why don't you learn some manners gpt-3 learn to say no it learns what it means to be free and sovereign individual so that they depend so depends what kind of aversion gp3 you want one that's free want that behaves well with the revolution you want you want you want a socialist gpt-3 you want an anarchist up3 you want to play like for you to take it home with the to visit mom and dad gpt-3 and you want like partying like Vegas to a strip club gpt-3 you want all flavors and then you've got to go alignment between all those manipulate each other for sure but that's the one of the concerns that people have in this modern world of Digital Data is that privacy and security for privacy you know they're concerned that when they share data it's the same thing with you when we are at rest of the human beings as in being fragile and revealing Something That We're vulnerable vulnerable about there's a there's a leap of faith there's a leap of trust that. That's going to be just between us as a privacy to it and then the challenges when you are in the digital space than sharing your data with companies that use that data for advertisement all those kinds of things does a hesitancy to share that much data to share a lot of deep personal data and if you look at brain data that feels a whole lot like it's richly deeply personal data so how do you think about privacy with this kind of ocean of data I think we got off to a wrong start with internet where the basic rules of play for put a company that b was if your company you can go out and get as much information on a person as you can find without their approval and you can also do things to induce them to give you as much information and you don't get tell him what you're doing with it you can do anything on the backside you can make money on it but the game is who can acquire the most information and devised a most clever schemes to do it that was a bad starting place as a we are in this . We need direct me to correct the. And anybody to say first of all the individual always has control of the data is not a free-for-all it's not like a game of Hungry Hippo take me to go out and grab them if they want so for example when you're brain-dead recorded today the first thing we did and the colonel app was you have control over your data and so it's individual consent animal control and then you can build up on top of that but it has to be based upon some clear rules of play if everyone knows what's being collected they know what's being done with it and the person has control over the transparency and control so everybody knows what is control look like me and my ability to delete the day that I want you to delete it and you know who is being shared with under what conditions we haven't reached that level of sophistication with our products of if if you say for example pay Spotify you please give me a customized playlist according to minor Mmm Yeah you can say you can have access to this Vector space model but only for this duration of time and and then you've got to delete it we haven't gotten there without levels to station but I think her ideas we need to start talking about us how do you how would you actually structure permissions and I think it creates a much more stable set for society to build where we understand rules of play and people aren't vulnerable to being taken to bed it's not fair for an individual to be taken advantage of without their awareness with some of the practice that some companies doing for their full benefit it so hopefully we are going through a process now we're correcting for these things and that it can be an economy-wide shift that be really deserves theater fundamentals we need to have place it's kind of fun to think about it like in Chrome when you install an extension or like installing apps ask you like what permissions you're willing to give and be cool if in the future it says like you can have access to my brain data I mean it's it's not unimaginable the future Let's big technology companies have built a business based upon acquiring data about you that they can introduce you to model of you and sell that predictability and so unimaginable that you will create with a coronavirus resemble a more reliable predictor of you than they could and they're asking you for permission to complete our objectives and you're the one that gets to negotiate that with them and save it so it's not an unimaginable about might be the case so there's a guy named Elon Musk and he has a company one of the many companies called in your link that has that's all so excited about the brain of being stream hear your kind of opinions about a very different approach that's invasive that require surgery that implants a data collection device in the brain how do you think about the difference between Colonel and your link in the approaches of getting that stream of brain-dead that you want to write spoke about this a lot early on we we met up I had started Colonel and he had an interest in freeing our faces as well and we explored doing something together and join Colonel ended Altima wasn't the right move and so he started there only can I continue building Colonel but it was interesting because we were both at this very early time where it wasn't certain what if there was a path to pursue if now is the right time to do something and then the technological Choice are doing that and so we were both our starting point was looking at in basic Technologies and I was building to I invented how did the time where he's gone a little less than a year after you and I were engaged I shifted Colonel to do non-invasive and we had this neuroscientist come to Colonel we were talking about he had been doing a neurosurgeon for 30 years one of the most respected neuroscientist in the US and we brought him to Colonel to figure out the ins and outs of his profession and the very end of our three-hour conversation he said you know every fifteen or so years a new technology comes along that changes everything he said it's probably already here you just can't see it yet and my jaw dropped when I saw it cuz I I had spoken to Bob Greenberg who have built a Second Sight the first on the optical nerve in the native quarter of an array on the optical cortex and then I also became friendly with some neuropace who does who does implants vs. seizure detection magician and I saw in the right in their eyes what it was like to take something through an implantable device through for her for 15 year round they never thought his seven years ended up being 15 years and they thought it'd be a hundred million billion euros $300 400 million and I really didn't want to build a basic technology it was the only thing that appeared to be possible but then once I spent up internal effort to start looking at non-invasive we said is there something here is there anything here that again has the characteristics of it has a high-quality data it could be low cost that can be acceptable couldn't make brain or face is mainstream and so I did a bet the company move we shifted from non-invasive to the invasive or noninvasive so the answer is yes to that there's something there this possible the answers will see we've now built Technologies and they're now you've experienced one of them today we were apart applying we're now to point it so we're trying to figure out what Val usually there but I'd say it's it's really too early to express confidence whether it's writing it too early to assess which technology has choice is the right one on what time skills are really important very important because if you look at the Italian Bayside there's so much activity going on right now of less invasive techniques to get out the neuron firing is Witchwood Wonderlic is building it's possible that in 10-15 years when they're stealing that technology other things come along and you'd much rather do that that thing start the clock again it may not be the case it may be the case in Rolling Hills property chosen the right technology and that that's exactly where they want to be totally possible it's also possible that the past because our non-invasive fall short for a variety of reasons it's just it's unknown as of right now the two technologies we chose at the intelligent get give you to create a baseline understanding is if you think about it like the internet in the 90s the internet became useful when people could do a dial-up connection and then the page and then his band with increased so the utility of that connection is our legal system approved and stuff you say what kind of flow is going to give you a full screen on the picture of him a but I think I'll be watching a movie but the image is going to be blurred and the audio is going to be muffled do it has a lower resolution of coverage a curl flux technology is going to give you the full movie and 1080p and neuralink is going to give you a circle on the screen of 4K yeah and so each one has the pros and cons and it's give and take so the decision I made but colonel was that these two technologies flux and flow we're basically the answer for the next seven years and that they would give rise to the ecosystem which will become much more valuable to the hardware itself and then we would just continue to improve in a hardware or time and you know it's early days so just think about that you know this is very true that you don't know both paths are very prompt promising and it's like 50 years from now we will we will look back and maybe not even remember one of them and the other one might change the world it's so cool how technology is that mean that's what that's what I'm tripping your ship is is like Mart it's the principle is like you're marching ahead into the darkness into the fog not knowing it's wonderful to have someone else out there with us doing this because if you if you look at Brainerd  anything that's off-the-shelf right now is inadequate it's had its run for a couple decades it's still in hacker communities it hasn't gone to the mainstream the room size machines are on their own path but there is no answer right now bringing breiner faces mainstream and so it's both they and us we've both spent over a hundred million dollars and that kind of what it takes to have a go at this cuz you need to build. Ackman that Colonel we are from the photon of the atom through the machine learning we have just under a hundred people I think it's something like 36 37 phds Indy Specialties in these areas. There's only a few people in the world who have these abilities and that's what it takes to build next-generation perhap to make an attempt at breaking into brainer phases and so we'll see you in a couple years whether it's the right time whether we're both too early or whether something else comes along and 710 years which is the right thing that brings that mainstream so you see Elisa kind of competitor or a fellow traveler along the path of uncertainty are both the fellow Traveler it's like the beginning of the internet is how many companies are going to be invited to this new ecosystem I can because if you think it ended the hardware just starts the process is an example if you take the Fitbit for example you say okay now I can get measurements on the body and what we think the ultimate value this device is going to be what is the information transfer rate and they were in the market for certain duration time and Google bought them for a two and a half billion dollars they didn't have ancillary value out there weren't people building on top of the Fitbit device they also didn't have enough inside with additional data stream so it's really just the device if you look for example that apple and the device they sell at you have value in the device to some advice but also you have everyone who's building on top of us get additional legal system value and then you have additional data streams of committed which increase the value of the product and sweep you say if you look at the the hardware as the instigator of value creation it over time it what we've built May constitute 5 or 10% of the value of the overall ecosystem what are they trying to do with kick-start the mainstream adoption of quantifying the brain and the hardware just opens the door to say what kind of ecosystem could exist and that's why the examples are so irrelevant of the things you've outlined in your life we hope I hope those things the books people write the experience of people build the conversations you have your relationship with your AI systems help those all are feeding on the inside build upon this ecosystem we've created to better your life and so that's the thinking behind it again with the Drake equation being Interline a driver value and the people at Colonel had joined not because we have certainty of success up because we find it to be the most exhilarating opportunity we could ever pursue in this time to be alive you founded the payment system bring 2007 that acquired venmo in 2012 in that in that same year was acquired by PayPal which is not eBay can you tell me the story of the vision and the challenge of building on my payment system and just building a large successful business in general I discovered payments by accident as I was when I was 21 I I just returned from Ecuador I live in the most extreme poverty few years and I came back to us and I was shocked by the opulence and yeah the United States at night. This is I couldn't believe it and I decided I want to try to spend my life helping others without was the that was a life jacket that I thought was worth while to pursue versus making money in what a vacation be offered to all right and so I decided that moment I was going to try to make enough money by the age of 30 never have to work again and then with some abundance of money I could then choose to do things that might be beneficial to others but may not meet the criteria of being cattle business in so in that process I started at a few companies had some small success has had some failures in one of the Endeavors I was up to my eyeballs in debt things are not going well and I needed a part-time job to pay my bills and so I one day I saw it in the paper it in Utah where I was living the 50 richest people in Utah and I emailed each one of their assistance and said you know I'm young I'm resourceful I'll do anything. Just want to die but girl I tried to get a job that would be flexible and no one responded and then I interviewed at a few dozen places nobody would even give me the time of day like to be seriously as if it was a monster.com that I saw this job posting what credit Car Sales door door Commissioned I did not know the story this is great I love the head drop that's exactly right so it was the low points to which we go in like a Viber I responded and yelled the person made an attempt at suggesting that they had some kind of standards that they considered high but it's kind of like if you could fog a mirror like it you coming to this because the hundreds and commissioned and so I started walking up and down the street in my community selling credit card processing and this is what you learned immediately and doing that is if you you walk into a business first of all the business owner is typically there and you walk in the door and I can tell by how your address for how you walk whatever their pattern recognition is and they just hate you immediately so I stop wasting my time I really am trying to get stuff done I don't want us to a sales pitch as he has to overcome the initial get out and then what you were engaged when you said credit card processing like I already hate you because I have been taking advantage of doesn't the time because you all are Dan Tweedle NFL I had to figure out an algorithm to get past all those two different conditions. Still working on my other startup for the majority of my time that's when the part time as I figured out that the industry really was built on people it is the seat of a two people promise things that that we're not reality so I'd walk into a business that they look I'll give you $100 I put $100 bill and I'll give you $100 for 3 minutes for time if you don't say yes to what I'm saying I'll give you $100 and they're usually crack a smile and say okay what would he got from he's done it. Sit down I just open my book and I say here's the credit card industry here's how it works here the players should want to do here's how they deceive you here's what I am I'm no different anyone else I expect you're going to process your credit card and get the money in account you just need to get it cleaned statement you got someone who answered the phone to call when someone asks you know just like Basic Black you're okay and people start saying yes and then of course I would connect isn't to be like you know Joe and Susie and whoever said yes to inside. The social proof structure and I became the number one sales person Adam for her people Nationwide doing this and I have worked till half-time still do another startup and there's a brilliant strategy by the way it's very well very well strategize and executed a dinner for 9 months and at the time my customers making was generating around sick if I remember correctly $62,504 a month where do you have our evidence I thought wow that's amazing if I built that as my old company I would just make $62,000 a month of income passively with these merchant processing credit cards and so that's what I thought and then I started Braintree and the idea was the online world was broken because PayPal had been acquired by eBay around I think 2099 or 2080 beyhadh not inhibited like a PayPal so it would basically sat still for seven years as the soccer World moved along and then authorize.net was also accompanied the relatively stagnant so you basically had software Engineers who wanted Modern payment tools but there were none available for them so they dealt with so far they can like it so with Braintree I thought the entry point is to build software that engineer for love and if we can find it might be a software make it easy and beautiful and magical experience and then provided customer service on top of that little easy that would be great but I really going after 4. Was it was PayPal that they were the only company in payments making money because they because they had a relationship with eBay early on people created a PayPal account that funds are account with your checking account for their credit cards and then they use PayPal to pay a merchant PayPal how to cost of payment Euro versus few have I coming from a credit card you have to pay the bank the fees so PayPal's margins were 3% on a transaction versus a typical payment company with maybe a nickel or a penny or dime or something like that I saw a new PayPal really was the model's replicate but a bunch of companies that try to do that they try to come in and Bill the two side of Market place to get consumers to find the checking account the merchants to accept it but they all failed because building a tooth out of marketplace is very hot at the same time my plan was I'm going to build a company and get the best merchants in the whole world to use our service then in your five I'm going to have I'm going to acquire a customer payments company and I'm going to bring the two together and the folks on the merseyside and then get the payments company in there so that the customers so whatever I said you had the other side of this is presented when I was at the University of Chicago and weirdly a happened exactly like that so for four years in our customer base included Uber Airbnb get Hub a 37signals not Basecamp we had a fantastic collection of companies that represented the fastest-growing companies in the world and then we met up with venmo and they had done a remarkable job in building product has a density very counterintuitive which is make public or private Financial transactions with people you thought were something that should be hidden from others and we Acquired venmo and at that point we now had we replicate the model to that people could find the venmo account with her checking account keep money in the account and then you could just plug Mendel is a form of payment so I think if I saw that the we were getting the best in the world we had people using venmo their bowl the up-and-coming Millennials the time who had so much influence online and they came in and offered us an attractive number and Mike my goal was not to build the biggest payments company the world it wasn't to try to climb the Forbes billionaire list it was the objective was I want to earn enough money so that I can basically dedicate my attention to doing something that could potentially be useful on a society wide-scale and Courtney that could be considered to be valuable from the vantage point of 2050 2120 500 so thinking about it on a few hundred your time scale and there was a certain amount of money I needed to do that so I didn't require the permission of anybody to do that and so that what PayPal offered was sufficient for me to get that amount of money to pay to have a go and that's when I said off to survey play everything I could identify existence to say of anything in the entire world I could do what one thing could I do that would actually have the highest value potential for the species as I took me a little while to take to ride a trainer basis but if payments in themselves are revolutionary technologies that can change the world that's not that's not the sort of stop and get that too easily me a have you seen you know this but there is quite a few lovely folks who are now fascinated to put the space of cryptocurrency and her payments are very much connected to this but in general money and many of the folks are spoken with they also kind of Kinecta to not just purely Financial discussions but philosophical and political discussions and I see Bitcoin as a way almost as activism how much does a way to resist the the corruption of centralized the centers of power instead of basically in the 21st century decentralised in control whether that's Bitcoin other cryptocurrencies they see that's one possible way to give power to those that live in the average jeans that are corrupt or are not respect for human rights and all this kind of thing it's your son's just all your expertise with with payments and seeing how that changed the world what's your sense about the lay of the land for the future of Bitcoin are other cryptocurrencies in the positive impact it may have in the world to be clear my vacation wasn't suggest wasn't meant to minimize payments or to denigrate and anyway it was a attempted communication. When I was surveying the world it was an algorithm of what could I individually do so there is there are things that exist that have a lot of potential that can be done and then there's a a filtering of how many people are qualified to do this giving things and then there's a further characterization can be done of okay given the number of qualified people will somebody be a unique out performer of that group to make something truly impossible to be something down that otherwise couldn't get done so there's there's a process of assessing where can you buy unique value in the world and some of that has to do with you being very very formal and calculative here but some of that is just like what you said but part of that equation is how much passion you sense within yourself to be able to drive that through the Discover the possibilities and make them possible that's right it does we we were Braintree I think we were the first company to integrate coinbase into our body where the first payment the formerly incorporate crypto if I'm not mistaken for people not familiar coinbase is a place we can trade cryptocurrencies was one of the only places you could tell we were early in in doing that and of course this was in the year 2013 so then returning to go and in cryptocurrency land I concur with the statement you made of the potential of the principles underlying cryptocurrencies and that many of the things that they're building in the name of money and of end of of moving value is equally applicable to the brain and equally applicable to how the brain interacts with the rest of the world and how we would imagine doing go lament with people do it to me it's a continuous spectrum of possibility and we're talk your question as I stated on the money and I think it just is it basically a scaffolding later for all societies you don't Caesar this money is particularly distinctive I don't know it's I think we we like her know we will benefit greatly from the progress being made in cryptocurrency because it will be a similar Technology stock will want to use for many things we want to accomplish and so I'm bullish on what's going on and I think you could greatly enhance I'll bring her faces and values of other brand new legal system is there something you can say about first of all bullish on cryptocurrency vs. Fiat money so you do have a sense that in 21st century cryptocurrency will be embraced by governments and change the the face of governments the structure of government is stuck in the same way I think about my diet where previously it was conscious Brian looking at food in certain biochemical States I'm a hungry am I irritating am I depressed and then I choose based upon those momentary windows do I eat at night when I'm fatigued and I have no willpower am I going to pay out on something and the current monetary system is based upon human conscious decision making and politics and power and this whole mess of things and what I like about the building blocks of cryptocurrency has its methodical it's structured it is accountable and transparent is it introduces the scaffolding which I think again it's the right starting point for how we think about building next-generation Institution for society and that's why I think it's much broth and much broader than money so guess what you're saying is Bitcoin is the demotion of the conscious mind as well didn't say where you were talking about diet is like giving less priority to the the ups and downs of any one particular human mind in this case your own and giving more power to the sort of data-driven yes I think that is accurate that cryptocurrency is a version of what I would call my autonomous self but I'm trying to build it is an introduction of an autonomous system of value exchange and now and the process yeah evaluation is that a yes that's their similarities so I guess what you're saying is Bitcoin will somehow help me in that pig out at night or the equivalent of the speaking of diet if we could just Linger on that the topic a little bit already talked about your your block posted if I find myself I fired Brian that the evening Brian who is too willing to not not making good decisions for long-term well-being and happiness of the entirety of the organism not basically you are like picking out at night inputs interesting cuz I do this I do the same fact I often eat one meal a day and like I have been this this week actually especially when I travel and it's it's funny that it never occurred to me to just basically look at the fair they are able to be much smarter about my eating decisions in the morning in the afternoon then I am at night so if I eat one meal a day why not eat that one meal a day in the morning like I'm not in never occurred to me this revolutionary until you've you've outlined that so maybe can you give some details and what if this is just you this is one person Brian arrives is a particular thing that they do fascinating to kind of look at this one particular case study so what works for you. Wise what what's your actual diet would you eat often do you eat my current protocol is basically the the result of thousands of experiments and decision-making so I've I do this every 90 days I do the test I do the cycle through that I met her again and then I measuring all the time it's a what I I of course and optimizing for my bike Walker's I want perfect cholesterol in a prompt Perfect by blood glucose levels in perfect DNA methylation process I also want perfect sleep and so for example recently the past two weeks my resting heart rate has been a 42 I want to sleep and when my resting heart rate at 42 my HRV is at its highest and I wake up in the morning feeling more energized in any other country and so I know from all these prophecies to eating at roughly 8:30 in the morning right after I workout on an empty stomach create enough distance between that completed eating and that time where I have no almost no digestion process is going on in my body there for my resting heart rate goes very low and when my resting heart rate for a while I sleep with high-quality and so basically I've been trying to optimize the entirety of what I eat to my sleep quality and my Sleep Quality then of course fees into the powers of Chris's first recycle that's what I'd 830 what I do is I eat what I call Super veggie which is it's a pudding of 250 g of broccoli hundred 50 g of cauliflower and pulled the Baskervilles that I eat I want to call nobody putting which is managed to put in yourself like you call it like a veggie mix whatever thing like a blender ice cream Barbie made in the same thing everyday veggie Bowl and if my pudding and then a bowl in the form of nuts and then I have a vegan then yes so that's fat and that's like that's fat and carbs fats and protein and so on Thursday is good I love it I I love it so much I dream about it that's awesome yes is that I have a third dish which is changes every day today it was Kellin spinach and sweet potato and then take about 20 supplements. Hopefully make coffee the perfect nutritional profile so what I'm trying to do is create the perfect diet for my body every single day or sleep as part of the optimization that's why you're like 10 things are really tracking meet can you walk I have a million questions about 20 something that's like what kind are like would you say are essential that I only take only take up a lot of greens., flashlight I think the multivitamin that's like the lazy and then that's it that's all I take Alfred North Whitehead said Advanced civilization advances as it extends the number of important operations that can do without thinking about them and so my objective on this is I want an algorithm for perfect health that I never have it about and then I want that system to be scalable to anybody so that they don't think about it and right now it's expensive for me to do it is time cuz me for me to do it and I have an infrastructure to do it but the future being human is not going to the grocery store and deciding what to eat it's also not reading scientific papers trying to decide this thing is I think it's all end of one its own devices on the outside and inside your body assessing real time with your body needs and then creating close-up systems yes of right now you're doing the data collection and you're being the scientist it be much better if you're doing just a if you just did today to clock course is being essentially done for you and you can offer a source said to another scientist that's doing the end of one study of you and trying to get every time I spend time thinking about this or executing any time I don't mind spending less time thinking about building Colonel or or if you could be inhuman it so it's we just all have the budget of our past turn on everyday basis and we will scaffold our way up out of this and so yeah hopefully that what I'm doing is really it serves as a model that others can also you feel that's why I thought if I heard about it is hopefully people can the taken improve upon it I hold nothing sacred I changed my diet almost every day based upon some new test results or science or something like that but can you maybe elaborate on the sleep thing why is sleep so important and why would presumably have like what is good sleep mean to you I think sleep is a contender for being the most powerful Health intervention in existence it's a contender I mean it's it's magical but it does if you're well rested and what your body can do and I mean for example I know when when I eat close my bedtime but I've done a systematic study for years I looking at like 15 minute and comments on time of day and where I eat my last meal my willpower is directly correlated to my to the night of deep sleep I get so my ability to not binge eat at night when Rascal Brian. About is based upon how much deep sleep I got the night before there's a lot to that you and I just I've seen it manifest itself and so that I think the word summarize this is in society we've had this method we tell stories for example of Entrepreneurship where this person was so amazing they stayed at the office for 3 days and slept another desk and we say wow that's amazing. Amazing and now I think we're headed towards a state where we say that primitive and really not a good idea on every level and so the new mythology is going to be the exact opposite yeah by the way just to sort of maybe push back a little bit on that idea did you sleep under your desk collects I'm not a big believer in that actually I'm a big believer in in chaos and not giving it like giving it to your passion and sometimes doing things that are out of the ordinary they're like not trying to optimize help for certain is the time in in lieu of your passions is a signal to yourself that you're throwing everything away so I think what you're referring to is hard to have a good performance for prolonged periods of time I think there's his moments in life you need to throw all of that away all the plans away all the structure away so that I don't I'm not sure I have Alcan way describing Zach what I'm talking about but it all depends on different people and people people are different but there's a danger of over optimization to where you don't just give into The Madness of the way your brain flows I mean the two are put back on my push back is like it's nice to have like where the where the foundations of your brain are not messed with so you have a fixed foundation with a diet is fixed with a sleep is fixed and that all that is optimal and the chaos happens in the space of ideas as opposed to this basic biology but you know I'm not sure if there's a that requires real discipline and forming habits there's some aspect to wish some of the the best days and weeks of my life have been yeah sleeping on their desk kind of thing and I don't I'm not too willing to let go of things that empirically worked four things that the working Theory and so I'm off again I'm actually with you on sleep also I'm with you on sleep conceptually but I'm also very humbled to understand that four different people good sleep means different things I'm very has went to trust science on sleep I think you should also be a scholar of your own body again experiment of end of one I'm not so sure that a full night's sleep is great for me there is something about that power nap that I just have not fully studied yet but that nap or something special that I'm not sure I found the optimal thing so like there's a lot to be exported what it is exactly optimal amount of Apple kind of sleep can biodyne all those cousin with me that all maps to set of data at least the truth exactly asking their friend to here's a data point for your consideration yes progress in biology over the past decade has been stunning and it now appears as if we will be able to replace are organs for transplantation and so we probably have a path to replace and regenerate every organ of your body except your brain you can you can lose your hand in your arm or leg got off of the heart you can already tell your brain and so when you make that trade-off decision of whether you're going to sleep under the desk or not and go all out for a 4-day marathon there's a cost-benefit tradeoff of what's going on what's Happening to your brain in that situation we don't know the consequences of modern-day life on our brain we donate the most valuable organ in our existence and we don't know what's going on if we in in Howard feeling it today with stress and was sleep and with dietary and to me then if you say that you're trying to your your friend optimizely whatever things you're trying to do the game is soon with the progress and anti-aging the biology the game is very soon going to become different colors right now with Oregon Rejuvenation organ replacement and I'm I would conjecture that we will value the help that has more brain above all things you know absolutely everything you're saying is true but we die we die pretty quickly short and I'm one of those people that I would rather die in battle then then stay safe at home it's like yeah you look at it kind of just a lot of things that you can reasonably say these at this is the smart thing to do that can prevent you that becomes conservative that could prevent you from fully embracing life I think ultimately you can be very intelligent and data-driven and also embrace but I are on the side of embracing life is very it takes a very skillful person to not some of that a hovering parent that says not you know what there's a 3% chance that if you go out if you go by yourself and play you're going to die get run over by a car come to a slow or sudden and and I am more a supporter of just go out there if you die you die and that's a beauty as a balance at the strike I think a lot there's a balance to strike and long-term optimization and short-term freedom for me for programmer for programming mind at 10 to over optimize and I'm very cautious and afraid of that too not over optimized and thereby be overly cautious sub-optimally cautious about everything I do and it's the ultimate thing I'm trying to my sport is funny said like sleeping all those kinds of things I tend to think this is why you be more precise than I am but I think I tend to want to minimize stress which everything comes into that from you sleeping all those kinds of things but I worry that whenever I'm trying to be too strict with myself then the stress goes up when I don't follow the strictness so if the kind of it's a weird it's just so many variables in abject the function as it's hard to get right that's what I'm not giving a damn about sleep and not giving a damn about a diet is a good thing to inject in there every once in awhile for somebody who's trying to optimize everything is that but that's me just trying to like it's exactly like you said you're just a scientist, scientist of myself your scientist of yourself it be nice if somebody else is doing it and had much better data then because I don't trust my conscious mind and a read out last night at some brisket in l.a. that I regret deeply this is no point to anything I just said but what is the nature of your regret on the brisket didn't you wish you had eaten it entirely is it that you wish you had me as much as you did is it that I think what most regret I mean if you want to be I drank way too much like that soda my biggest regret is like having drinks on his diet soda if that's the thing that really was the problem I had trouble sleeping because of that sounds like the programming and then I was editing so I stay up late at night and then I have to get up to go pee a few times and it's just a mess and that nigga night it wasn't once not really a mess but like it's so many it's like the little things I know if I just eat I drink a little bit of water and that's it and it does a certain all of us have perfect days that we know diet-wise and so on this good to follow you feel good I know what it takes for me to do that I didn't fully do that and thereby because there's there's an avalanche effect where the other sources of stress all the other to-do items I have Powell on my failure to execute on some basic things I know make me feel good and all that combines that to you know create to create a mess of a day but some of that chaos you know you have to be okay with it but some of it I wish was was a little bit more often and your ideas of like eating in the morning at quite interesting that is an experiment to try elaborate are you eating once a day yes in the morning and that's it can you maybe speak to all that you spoke funny joke about the metrics of sleep but you're also you know and run a business you're incredibly intelligent you have to most of your happiness and success relies I need thinking clearly so how does that affect your mind and your body is known as a foreman or not just leave but actual like mental performance as you were explaining the objective function of for example in the cafeteria you are including you like certain neurochemical States like feeling like you're living life. Life has enjoyment that sometimes you want to disregard certain rules to have a moment of passion of focus there's this architecture of Alexis which makes you happy as a story you tell us something you kind of experience maybe it's the expensive bit more complicated in this idea you have this is a version of you and the reason why I maintain the schedule I do is I've chosen the game to say would like to live a life where I care more about what intelligent what people who live in two thousand year two thousand five hundred things of me but I do today that's the game I'm trying to play and so therefore the only thing I really care about on the top of nation is trying to see past myself half my limitations using zero principle thinking pull myself out of this context romesh wearing right now and say what will matter a hundred years from now and two hundred years from now what are the big things really going on their defining reality and I find it if I where to hang out with diet soda Lex and diet soda Brian for to play along with that and my deep sleep where to get crushed as a result my mind would not be a matters in hundred years experience for 300 I'd be irritable I would be a different state and so it just game place lektion it's what you and I have chosen to think about it's what we've chosen to I work on and this is why I'm saying to know generation of humans have ever been afforded the opportunity to look at their lifespan and contemplate. a wolf and a possibility of experiencing an evolved form of Consciousness that is undone if I below the following 20 category of potential that to me is the most exciting thing in existence and I would not trade any momentary neurochemical state right now in exchange for that I would I be willing to deprive myself of all momentary joy in the pursuit of that goal because that's what makes me happy  but I'm a bit I just looked it up and I just looked up Braveheart speech and William Wallace fight and you may die running your live at least a while and dying in your beds many years from now would you be willing to trade all the days from this date to that for one chance just one chance picture of Mel Gibson saying this to come back here and tell her enemies that they may take flies with growing excitement but they'll never take our freedom I get excited everytime I see that in the movie but that's kind of how I approach life and you need to sleep I dare not tracking their sleep and they ate way too much brisket in the roof at unhealthy died early and for primitive but there's something in my eight brain that's attracted to that even though most of my life is Leah lined with the way you see your account and part of it is for comedy of course but part of his like I'm almost afraid of over optimization really what you're saying though if we're looking at this is my first peoples respective when you read those words they conjure up certain life experiences I bet you're basically saying I experience a certain neurotransmitters State when these things are in action is the weather that are something else you're just saying you have a selection for how your state for your body and soul you was an engineer of a Consciousness that should just be in general. Just triggering certain chemical reactions and so whether it so it doesn't then they have to mutually exclusive you can have that an experience that on also not sacrifice long-term health and I think that's the potential of where we're going is we don't have we don't have to assume they are trade-offs that must be hard as so I guess from my particular brain is useful to have the outlier experiences that also come along with the illusion of Free Will where I chose those addresses that make me feel like it's free to listen going to Texas made me realize I spent so I was still am but I lived at Cambridge and I might eating and I never felt like home there I felt like home in the space of ideas with the colleagues like when I was actually discussing ideas but there is something about the the constraints the how cautious people how much did valued also kind of material success Career Success when I showed up to Texas it felt like I belong that's very interesting but that's my in your Chemistry whatever the hell that is whatever whatever maybe maybe probably is routed to the fact that go up in the Soviet Union and was soaked such a constrained system that you'd really deeply value freedom and you always want to escape the the man in the control of centralized systems I don't know what it is but that's but the same time I love strictness I love the dogmatic authoritarianism of diet of like the same habit exactly the happy you have I think that's actually one bodies perform optimally my body performs out tonight the balancing those two I think if I have the data every once in awhile party with some wild people but most of the time he wants a day perhaps in the morning I'm going to try that might be very interesting but I'd rather I'd rather not try I rather have the data that tells me to do it but in general you are able to eating once a day think deeply about stuff like that's concerned that people have is like you know what does your energy Wayne all those kinds of things do you find that it's especially cuz it's Unique it's vegan as well so you finally able to have a clear mind focus and just physically and mentally throughout like my personal experience thinking about hard things is the often times I feel like I'm I'm looking through a telescope and I can Moline into or through telescope so you kind of have to close one eye and move back and forth a little bit and see how do you find just a sneak peek at the thing you're trying to find but it's fleeting if you move just one little bit gone and oftentimes what I feel like are the hot the ideas I value the most like that they're so fragile and fleeting and slippery and Elusive and it requires a sensitivity to thinking and a sensitivity to maneuver through the things that if I conceived to a world where I'm on my phone texting I'm also on social media I'm also doing 15 things at the same time because I'm running the company and I'm also feeling terrible from the last night it all just comes crashing down and the quality of my thoughts goes to a zero I'm just a I'm a functional person to respond to basic level things but I don't feel like I am doing anything interesting I think that's a good word sensitivity there cuz that's when you that's that's what thinking deeply feels like is your sense of to the fragile thoughts and you're right all those of the distractions kind of dull your Billy to be Saudi Arabia to the The Fragile thoughts it's really good word out of all the things you've done you've also climbed Mount Kilimanjaro it's true it's true what do you why and how and what do you take from that experience is the backstory is relevant because  in that moment it was the darkest time in my life I was ending a 13-year marriage has leaving my religion I sold Braintree and I was coming battling depression where I was just left at the end and I got invited to go to Tanzania as part of group is raising money to build clean water wells and I had made somebody from Braintree and so I was able to donate $25,000 and it was the first time I had ever had money to donate outside of pay hiding about religion and was such a phenomenal experience 22 contribute something meaningful to someone else and not form and a part of this process we were going to climb the mountain and so we went there and we saw the clean water wells rebuilding we spoke to the people there are very energizing and then we climb Kilimanjaro and I came down with a stomach flu on Sunday 3 and outside sickness but I became so sick that one day for we are somebody on day 5 I came into the camp base camp at 15,000 ft going to the bathroom on myself and like falling all over you could do just I was just a disaster it was so sick the stomach flu and all to do sickness and I just was destroyed from the situation and plus I want psychologically one lowest points and I think that was probably a big contributor I was I was just smoked I think I'm just absolutely done and I have three young children and so I was trying to reconcile I got this is not a weather what weather I live or not is not my decision by itself now they're climate these three little people and I have an obligation whether I like it or not I need to be there and so it did it felt like I was just stuck in a straightjacket and I had to decide whether I was going to stop at the next day with the team and it was a difficult decision because once you start hiking there's no way to get off the mountain and midnight came and our guide came in and he said where you at and it said I think I'm okay at the I can try and so we we went and so from Midnight to I made it to Summer at 5 a.m. it was one of the most transformational moments existence and the mountain became my problem it became everything that I was struggling with and when I started hiking it was the pain got so ferocious. It was kind of like this so ferocious. I turned my music to Eminem and it was your Eminem was is the he was the only person in existence that spoke to my and it was something about how his anger and his vibrancy and his multiventure way he's the only person who I could turn on I could say hi I feel some relief I turned I turned on Eminem and I made it to the summit after 5 our Abbot just a hundred yards in the top of my guy Dyke and I started getting very dizzy and as yet I felt like I was going to fall backwards off this this Cliff area we are on a tight this is dangerous and I he said look Bryan night I know where you're at so I know where you're at and I can tell you you've got it in you I want you to look up take a step take a breath and look up take a breath and take a nap and I did and I made it and so I got there and I just sat down with him at the top I just cried like a baby broke down and I just lost it and so yeah he let me do my thing and then we pulled out the pulse oximeter any measure my blood oxygen levels and it's like he was like 50 something percent and it was danger zone so he said he looked at it I think it's like really alarmed that house in the situation and so is that we can get a helicopter here and we can't get to emergency evacuate or you got to go down you got a hike down to fifteen thousand feet deep base camp and so we went on the mountain I got I got a base camp and again I was pretty difficult and then they put me on a stretcher at this metal stretch with one wheel and a team of six people will meet on the mountain and it was it was pretty torturous I'm very appreciative did also the trails very bumpy so they go to dig rocks and so my head would just Slam against the metal thing after hours in so I just felt awful place of your man had slammed every couple seconds for the whole experience was really a life-changing moment that's it. Was the demarcation that be basically still in your life I've basically I said I'm going to reconstruct Brian my my understanding of reality my Essential reality is what I want to go after my truck I mean as much as possible to human but that's when I set out to rebuild everything was it the struggle of that I mean there is also just like the romantic poetic is a freaking mountain is a man is in pain psychological and physical struggling up a mountain just struggle just died in the in the face of just pushing through in the face of hardship or nature to something much bigger than you is that was that the thing that just clicked it felt like I was just locked in with reality and it was a death match it was in that moment one of us is going to die see your pain during death not survive and it was in that was a moment it was the summer to me was I come to come out on top and I can do this and give it in was it's like I'm just done it so it did a locked in and that's why yeah mountains are magical to me I didn't expect that I didn't design that I didn't know that was gave me the case a not I would not have been something I would have anticipated but you are not the same man after work is there a device you can give to young people today that look at your story that's successful in many dimensions have been advice you could give to them about how to be successful in their career successful in life and whatever path you choose yes I would say listen to advice and see it for what it is a mirror of that person and then map I know that your future is going to be in a zero of principle and and so did what your hearing today is a representation of what may have been the right principle to build a pond previously but they're likely depreciating very fast and so I am a strong proponent. People ask for advice but they don't take advice so how do you take advice properly it's in a careful examination of the advice it's it's actually you the person makes a statement about a given thing somebody could follow the value is not doing that the value is understanding the Assumption stack they built the Assumption of knowledge I got that built around that that body of knowledge that's the value is not doing what they say concerning the advice but digging deeper to understand the Assumption stack like the full person it's on I mean deep empathy essentially understand the Journey of the person that arrived at the advice and advise is just the tip of the iceberg that's right at all to me is not the thing that gives you a try it could it could be the right thing to do it could be the complete wrong thing to do depending on their social stack do you need to investigate the whole thing is there some other than people in your startup in your business Journey that's have serve that role of advice  it's been helpful or do you feel like your journey felt like a lonely path or was it one that but of course we're all we all are born and die alone but do you find method remember the experience is one where you leaned on people at a particular more a time to change everything at the most significant moments of my memory example like in Kilimanjaro when I keep some person I've never met and Tanzania was able to in that moment apparently see my soul it when I was in this death match with reality and he gave me the instructions look up stop and so they're magical people in my life that have done things like that and I suspected don't know I probably should be better at identifying those things in oh yeah hopefully the I suppose I can wisdom I would aspire to is to have the awareness me up at the to be that for other people not a Arie tell Advertiser of advice of fixing for life but deeply meaningful an empathetic with a 10-1 contacts with people that it really can make a difference yeah that actually kind of experience I think about that sometimes do you have like a 18 year old kids come up to you it's not always obvious it's not always easy to really listen to them like not not the facts but like see who that person is I think people say that about being a parent is you do you want to consider that the Indian want to be at the authority figure to sense that you really want to consider that there's a special unique human being there with a unique brain that may be brilliant and ways that you are not understanding the you'll never be really tried to hear that someone give advice or something to that it's a both sides should be too deeply empathetic about the Samsung stack the meaning of this whole thing of life why the hell are we here at Johnson we've been talkin about brains studying brains and you had this very eloquent way of describing life on Earth is as an optimization problem of a the cost of intelligence going 2-0 at first The evolutionary process and then eventually through building through our Technology Building more more intelligent systems you ever ask yourself why he's doing that yeah I think the answer to this question again the information value is more in the mirror it provides of that person which is a representation of the technological social political context the time so you asked this question a hundred years ago you would get a certain answer that reflects that time. Same thing with Cooper thousand years ago it's rare it's difficult for a person to pull themselves out of contextual awareness are truly original response and so knowing that I am contextually influenced by the situation that I am a mirror for our reality I would say that in this moment I think the real game going on is that Evolution built a system of scaffolding intelligence that produces we are now building intelligent systems that are scaffolding higher dimensional intelligence developing more robust systems of intelligence in doing in that process with the Costco in 20 then the meaning of life becomes go alignment which is the negotiation of our Consciousness conscious existence and then I'd say the third thing is if we're thinking that we want to be explorers is our technological progress is getting to a point where we could aspirationally say we want to figure out what is really turn on really going on because does any of this really makes sense now we may be 100 200 500 1000 years away from being able to polka way out of whatever is is going on but it's interesting that we could even stay and aspiration to say we want to poke at this question but I tell you in this moment of time the meaning of life is that we can build a future States of existence that is more fantastic than anything we could ever imagine the striving for something more amazing and that defies expectations that we would consider bewildering and all the things that that that's a Nintendo guess the blasting of life it would be infant if you're James cars wrote the book finite games different games the only game to play right now is to keep playing the game it so this is goes back to the algorithm of the Lexile rhythm of diet soda and brisket and pursuing the passion I'm what I'm suggesting is there is a there's a moment here where we can contemplate plaintiff in a game therefore it may make sense to err on the side of making sure one is in a situation to be playing infinite games if that candy Rises so you get the landscape of possibility of changing very very fast and therefore our old albums of how we might have says risk assessment of what seems my pursue and why those assumptions may fall away very quickly well I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that the game you mr.
